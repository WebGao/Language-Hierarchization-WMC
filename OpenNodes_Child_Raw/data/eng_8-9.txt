one to face each other .
but a straight line .

you could skip a piece .
or you could just go one .

Squidword .
Squigward (.) or whatever .
Gary , his cat .

then it shows you the way to
go to wherever she wants to go .
and then she goes .

I like it because sometimes the question are kind of challenging .
no .
-um (.) I watch during weekdays .

she went in .
sh (.) and then I don't think she saw the rabbit again .
and then .
mmm .
and (.) then -um (.) she went to another door .
no .
she can't get in .
because one thing it's locked .

f she f -um (.) there were other doors .
too .
so she's try to fit in each of them .
but each of them , the locks .
they were neither too small or too big .
s then she tried the smallest door .
and then it fit fit through .
then she opened it .
but her head wouldn't even fit in .
so she ran back to the table .
but first she had to look if it was like poisonous or something .
and she didn't .
so she drank it .
and then she shrunk into about this size .
and but then -um she noticed that she forgot the key on the table .
so (.) and now she can't get up .
because she's only this tall .
and the table's about like this that tall .
and she tried to climb up .

so and then she she saw this mouse .
then (.) she started talking to it .

the salad dressin(g) .
kind ?
whatever kind there is .
-uh well (.) -um .
I would like it .

hm: .
-um (.) you just get the board with the -um (.) points .
like there .
and you could use (.) -um ten pieces or .
six pieces .
and -um we have to have two .
one to face each other .
but a straight line .
and you could skip one .
you could skip a piece .
or you could just go one .
well you could jump (.) over whatever one .
but you could only jump over one .
-um they could be neither thing .
in China when I played .
it was small marbles .
in here when I played .
it was a circle on the top .
like that .
s and you try to get on each other's side .
well you have to get on each other's side .
whoever gets there first , wins .
yeah .
I like watching tv .

Spongebob .
Dora .
Berenstain Bears .

it's he's a sponge .
-um he lives in Bikini Bottom in the pineapple .

he has Sandy , Patrick , Mister Crabs .
Squidword .
Squigward (.) or whatever .
Gary , his cat .
who's an snail .
-um (.) hm: .
and that's about it .
-um like she tries to get somewhere .
and then the map perps out .
then it shows you the way to
go to wherever she wants to go .
and then she goes .
but usually I only
I like it because sometimes the question are kind of challenging .
no .
-um (.) I watch during weekdays .
but sometimes (.) I just read too much .
-um it's my school library book .
it's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland .
-um (.) Alice she was sitting on the steps .
in front of her house .
with her bigger sister .
I forgot her name .
and then she went for a walk .
and then she tripped .
sh and fell in a big rabbit hole .
and then she started falling down .
down down .
no .
actually (.) when she was still sitting with -uh her big sister .
she saw the rabbit .
and then the rabbit hopped down the rabbit hole .
and then she decided she would too .
and then she started falling and falling .
until she came to these big , long doors .
she went in .
sh (.) and then I don't think she saw the rabbit again .
and then .
mmm .
and (.) then -um (.) she went to another door .
no .
she can't get in .
because one thing it's locked .
and the other she's too big .
so she found the key .
and she found the key .
f she f -um (.) there were other doors .
too .
so she's try to fit in each of them .
but each of them , the locks .
they were neither too small or too big .
s then she tried the smallest door .
and then it fit fit through .
then she opened it .
but her head wouldn't even fit in .
so she ran back to the table .
but first she had to look if it was like poisonous or something .
and she didn't .
so she drank it .
and then she shrunk into about this size .
and but then -um she noticed that she forgot the key on the table .
so (.) and now she can't get up .
because she's only this tall .
and the table's about like this that tall .
and she tried to climb up .
but it was too slippery .
so she sat there and cried .
soon she found her in in her own pool of tears .
and then -um (.) sh it flooded .
then other creatures got flooded too .
so and then she she saw this mouse .
then (.) she started talking to it .
then she mentioned of cats and dogs .
and then the the mice got frightened .
-um and then they found a few other creatures .
-uh they found a piece of dry place .
kli so they went up on it .
then they try to dry theirselves .
mmm and then (.) -um the the mouse mouse trying to like .

one Sunday morning the warm sun came up and pop out of the egg came a tiny and very hungry caterpillar .
he started to look for some food .
on Monday he ate through one apple but he was still hungry .
on Tuesday he ate through two pears but he was still hungry .

the night (.) he had a stomachache .

I was two meters ahead of the second person .
I don't know .
math I guess .
hockey .
I beat six boys on a team .
serious !
and I had this other boy on my team that could barely skate .
so I had to teach him how to skate and play .
so hard .
but I I did beat them with three shots !
-uh yeah I guess so .
kind of .
no .
I don't know .
yeah .
which dad ?
this one or the one in Romania ?
-uh the one in Romania is really good at running .
and
I guess so .
(be)cause you
he's good at biking .
yeah .
can't say I'm too good .
-um .
well we usually have about ten .
eleven people .
yeah .
and then -um there's a part of the competetion that's called
it's an event called creative .
they play music and you have to dance to it .
and you get metals for that .
I got fourth .
but there were twenty people in the thing .
yeah .
yeah .
you just do it .
so it's just (.) how you feel the music .
yeah .
it actually gets you ready for higher levels .
it's a good exercise .
yeah .
I can say that too .
I got fouth on that .
yeah .
pretty .
yeah .
I have a competetion this summer .
yeah .
I'm going to do that again .
yeah .
yeah .
where ?
it was at Callingwood arenas .
Mayfield if you don't know .
past the mall .
mmm no .
two days long for me .
sometime three days long but for the older guys .
but for the little guys two days .
-uh everything that other people had .
you know the good guys like on the tv ?
that's the same as me .
except I have to do just single jumps .
no no doubles .
no nothing .
(be)cause it's hard to do doubles .
yeah .
I fell .
so I just did it half rotation .
yeah .
yeah it is .
no .
I landed on two feet and then I
I I can actually land on one foot .
and just turn and go backwards again .
I landed once .
yeah .
it guess so .
interesting .
yeah .
(be)cause it's hard to go to school and skate .
yeah .
-um no !
yeah I guess so .
good .
Mister Kayar .
and we always make fun of it .
Mister Kayar makes good cookies .
and he does (be)cause (.) in the rocks and minerals thing at science .
we -uh we we did actually a a recipe for cookies .
but we on the recipe they actually put like real rocks to make like a mineral .
so it was related so we got to make cookies .
he makes brownies !
-uh yeah .
everything .
yeah .
he's the cook guy .
he's a cook good cook guy .
yeah .
sweets .
no .
we just get junk food .
that's fine though .
at parties we get
but sometimes we get junk food .
we get lot of fruit and a big bag of chips .
like that big bag of chips .
it's not bad
yeah .
pretty bad .
three .
-uh I don't know .
yeah .
no !
no !
oh in grade one it was so bad !
the end of grade one and at the beginning of grade two .
the boys poor them !
the girls were running after them .
and when they caught them .
they were about to kiss them !
it was gross !
it was gross !
it was fun though .
it was fun though .
for
for us it was fun (be)cause the girls chased the boys .
kissed them .
they boys didn't come back .
(be)cause they were too scared of the girls !
so it was fun .
it was fun .
yeah .
I caught actually a few .
didn't get to kiss them though !
yeah .
too gross .
and the teachers come and watch .
so
a boy .
it's a boy .
I think .
yeah .
second or third .
yeah pretty close .
pardon ?
easy !
yeah .
good grades .
no .
we did this map map of the school .
school ground and stuff .
and I got an a plus on that .
I saw somebody that got a d minus on that .
it was terrible !
you should have seen it !
the the soccer tents were like that .
a big line .
yeah .
that's for the soccer tent .
and the school was just like that .
a big square .
it didn't say school on it .
so that got into a d .
there was no colour !
so it was d minus !
yeah .
yeah .
yes .
suppose so .
math !
I don't know .
it's fun .
yeah .
nothing !
no .
okay .
division .
well division I
that kind of division is hard .
yeah .
this year I was really good .
(be)cause Mister Kayar .
he stayed for a few hours on me to see if I got an a .
so
and he put a b .
yeah .
yeah .
it is .
yeah .
yeah .
about Romania ?
it's warm there .
way warmer .
at winter it only goes to about minus ten minus fifteen .
so it's not too cold .
it goes here to minus thirty .
I once had to go out skating at minus twenty degrees !
that was fun though .
yeah .
big jacket .
yeah .
big jacket .
big snowsuits and stuff .
no .
I keep them open all of the time !
well my eyes freeze open usually .
so I have to keep them open .
and then when I get inside the house .
I can finally close them .
yeah .
-um .
yeah .
less skating rinks .
yeah .
they cost a lot of money to get .
-um nope .
yeah .
when I'm a champion .
I suppose .
yeah .
ten years ?
eight .
so about sixteen to eighteen .
that's the good part .
when if then you are really good then .
when you get older you will be better .
when you get about twenty .
I don't know .
I'll be famous !
I don't know .
I hope .
yeah .
-uh .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
hi everybody !
(be)cause then I won't have to speak to different people .
-um yeah .
-uh .
who cares !
yeah .
at least I have the gold metal !
at least I didn't fall in my program !
to get a metal at the Olympics .
yeah .
oh yeah .
yeah .
and -um (.) the the Olympics is going to
next year was it ?
no I think it was this year the Olympics .
yeah .
yeah next year they're going to be in Italy .
and then .
do you know the skater Carolina Kostner ?
she's an Italy skater .
so she's going to have her home crowd .
that's going to be a lot of pressure on her .
but it's going to be fun .
yeah .
I'm going to watch that .
and I'm going to met her in person !
I don't know (be)cause
my librarian is her daughter is a coach .
and it's Carolina Kostner's coach .
so they're coming .
and they're going to visit .
they're going to visit the school so .
I get to meet her at school .
no .
Jen skates .
-um no .
she started after me .
and she's ten .
so she's a little older than me .
but she won first place in the competition .
for elements .
yeah so she's good .
mmm can't think of anybody else .
that's not too much .
I know .
I'm serious .
it's a lot of people .
that's because it's the best junior high school .
and the ten top best elementary school .
yeah .
so it's going to be
it's quite a big school .
and then they have to make draws to get more people in every year .
(be)cause people live leave from -uh from the junior high sometimes every year .
so they get more people in .
Geedee .
I don't know .
probably a high school .
it's it's the red school down the road .
so you go down the road .
and then you have to turn to the left .
actually just go down the road .
and you'll see a red school .
on your left .
yeah like that way .
that's the left side if you're going that way .
you have to go that way .
and then look there .
that's the school .
I don't know .
I will have to see that .
yeah .
maybe .
skater .

let's play !

ah whatever .
I like playing with that .
I kept on pulling it .
so it got off .
I know .
who cares now ?
yeah .
that's because from the competition .
no .
it looks nice .
well I have five upstairs .
yeah .
I used to have two but -uh
one of my friend's mom .
from skating .
she gave me another two .
so I had four .
and then one of the senior skater's mom .
she gave me one because I had to use that for the competition .
so now I have five .
but I have to give the one that the senior gave me .
I have to give it back .
and then I'll have four .
I don't know .
yeah .
I have to borrow it .
and then I have to use it for a wildrose .
and then I have to give it back .
-uh I don't know .

no .
not really .
I don't know how to explain it .
yeah fun .
yeah .
piano , flute , guitar .
music ?
no .
your teacher .
your coach chooses the music .
and they teach you what to do to the music .
yeah .
well actually sometimes you can decide .
after you get older .
so .
mmm .
yeah not too long actually .
I've taken lessons for about two years almost .

they play music and you have to dance to it .
and you get metals for that .
I got fourth .

the the soccer tents were like that .
a big line .
yeah .
that's for the soccer tent .

yeah .
yeah .
about Romania ?
it's warm there .

that was fun though .
yeah .
big jacket .
yeah .
big jacket .
big snowsuits and stuff .

-um .
yeah .
less skating rinks .

they cost a lot of money to get .
-um nope .

that's going to be a lot of pressure on her .
but it's going to be fun .
yeah .
I'm going to watch that .

I don't know (be)cause
my librarian is her daughter is a coach .

I get to meet her at school .

it's a lot of people .
that's because it's the best junior high school .

so it's going to be
it's quite a big school .
and then they have to make draws to get more people in every year .

so they get more people in .
Geedee .
I don't know .
probably a high school .
it's it's the red school down the road .
so you go down the road .

seals .
see they just just bite each other .
uhhuh .
(be)cause there's probably blubber in
there's under a thick fat called bludder bludder .
blubber .
sometimes I get mixed up up the words .
uhhuh .
and see its actually its claws are not that sharp .
so one hit -uh won't actually be that hurt .
uhhuh .
foxes .
some aren't .
some are different .
this this is the red fox .
probably grey and white .
like the arctic fox .
and actually related to dogs .
relat(ed) .
mmhm .
they act like one .
mmm half skunk .
and these are all of black bears or whistle in the water !
brown bears .
Alaska brown bears .
there's also called grizzly bears .
mmm just (be)cause if they're brown .
mmm people said if you played dead .
mmm he I think you can play dead .
bears won't attack you when you're dead .
uhhuh .
uhhuh .
don't just breathe , okay ?
just don't breathe .
and then it go away .
that's a chimpan(zee) chimpanzee .
mmm .
-uh well I think that is from the sunlight .
it just looks like a human .
I can't tell
probably
the lion's club cubs .
you know my favourite animal is is k is the killer whales .
no they're not !
that's some
probably .
let me see .
will not hurt the cubs .
actually .
between their teeth .
and just carry them to somewhere .
no .
they won't .
I think they they just got born somehow .
just waddled .
mmm this one .
see .
and th th the li the lion is like the crawl crawl on her .
and and bit her gentily .
one curious cub even put his paw in the lioness's mouth !
and will not hurt these guys , okay ?
I like killer whales (be)cause (be)cause they only eat everything .
that's a baby brown bear .
snow .
that's a baboon .
and this a wolf .
and but but my most favourite animal is the blue whale .
it's the largest animal of the world .
that's a wolf .
-uh -um -um actually the wolf hold the -um -um
I can't really s tell .
they looks almost just like each other .
they they're an ancenstors of dogs .
once in in the past .
there were no dogs .
uhhuh so .
and the early dogs live in trees .
soon the wolves got up the trees .
but actually the early foxes still living on trees actually .
now they're probably not .
and I'll show you -um this the seal .
their body .
okay .
that's all of this (.) pic(ture) .
uhhuh .
-um my mom buy it .
oops .
boing .
I also have a bunny .
nig nig nog .
well we they're all friends .
we just having
yes .
mmhm .
mmm this name ?
his -um name is David .
m m m .
that I put it actually back in so .
so I think
and his name is Sam .
mmhm .
I named them by myself .
first I thought one name in Al(ly) Ally .
but then acutally actually his name is Ally (be)cause of this .
Ally .
his name is Ally .
(...) three .
-uh (...) eight .
mmhm .
October the thirteenth .
mmhm .
mmm yeah .
mmm I I I went to celebrate at my friend's house .
we just played .
play .
mmm just one .
I just went to one friend's house .
-uh not too far .
we play something .
hm: we play dinosaurs .
he has some dinosaurs there but not as many as mine .
we just get some and grr .
grr .
mmhm .
they are one of my favourite an(imals) .
(be)cause a lot of them are huge !
mmm some of them ate plants and some of them ate meat .
just like today's animals !
mmm espec(ially) well the only different (be)cause is they have no fur .
(be)cause they're reptiles .
they're extinct giant lizards .
they means terrible giant lizard .
mmhm .
no !
they're extinct .
it means they probably die .
they died .
uhhuh all of them .
-um -um the sciences still didn't find out yet .
they there are many theories theories .
yeah theories .
I can't get the words right sometimes .
theories .
there's some theories .
a lot of theory .
one is a giant asteroid crashed the earth .
and just blocked the dust .
so the dinosaurs can't eat everything .
only they die .
then they will probably kill each other for some food .
they won't have enough things .
another one is just the world got too cold or too hot for the dinosaurs to live .
-uh probably the weather changed .
probably the ice age were gonna come .
well another theories was was about this you know .
it's there were small mammals of at that times .
and they probably just steal the dinosaurs eggs to eat .
mmhm .
that's probably for killing .
that means the won't
but actually I don't know
that's that's for the e .
the animals will eat the dinosaurs eggs .
hm: my my grandpa told me it was about volcanoes !
volcano blast !
and the lava just just went down .
and probably burned the plants and was the dinosaurs .
they just burned down .
and some maybe drown in rivers .
ah !
I don't know .
uhhuh .
he says the dinosaur's extinction was about s
a long time ago there's something called lava .
it have a kind of poison gas .
sees how a volcano is blasts out a poison gas .
and it'll go down into the grass .
that's how he say it .
and the eggs they were
they laid on
can't can't hatch baby dinosaurs .
I don't think I believe that .
that's a new theor(y) theories .
(be)cause I scientist in China found found dinosaur eggs .
and break the shell and sees there's something in it .
some scientists said probably some dinosaurs evolved into birds .
-uh birds are the closest ancestors of of of of dinosaurs .
(be)cause (be)cause a early bird called called
it starts with a a .
it's called ar ar .
probably start with a a .
and I forgot the name .
hm: it was a bird .
and it was the earliest bird ever .
but it's actually a reptile with wings .
(be)cause it's skeleton just looked just like a dinosaur skeleton .
and unlike today's birds they have teeth !
well one has .
they they just swollow !
they doesn't ch chew .
mmm they just grab it and just gulp .
glup .
they just swallow it .
mmhm .
mmhm .
I can also know some monsters .
but I don't think they actually do exist .
but there's three a lot of beasts like stuff .
but there's three kinds of monsters that I cannot stand .
most of them doesn't exist .
everybody s keeping seeing them .
uhhuh .
-uh they're
it's it's white .
and it's hairy and .
and it walk in the snow .
sometimes we called it a aomible snowman .
yeah .
abominable snowman .
abominable snowman .
and they leave footprints .
mmhm .
I no .
what is it about ?
monsters .
oh .
and they want to get this world ?
oh huh ?
huh ?
probably that's true !
uhhuh .
(be)cause maybe they kick out .
they probably just from outer space or somewhere .
they got here probably by a spaceship .
yeah .
because everybody keeps seeing them .
the (.) sasquatches .
like the bigfoots .
in China there's a lot .
one one one people have photo of one .
they walk just like a human !
and they saw one .
-uh just another su someone saw see it .
no .
because I don't live in the forest .
mmhm .
mmhm .
no -um no .
why ?
-um Alberta .
yeah .
ah !
in Vancouver ?
mmhm .
ah ah .
mmhm .
ah !
sasquatches right here ?
do they eat people ?
I
mmhm .
that would be great !
maybe I can get front row tickets for for the amusement park .
mmm .
mmm mmm and there was someone else (.) see seeing it .
a girl who was about to go home .
and it's mother .
they they they killed the monster .
and just cut off his hands and foot .
and bring it to the museum .
and we just think it's one of them .
for the bigfoot .
they live in Scotnow Scotland .
do you know where Scotland is ?
oh it's in Europe ?
ah !
it's close to Asia !
oh .
mmhm .
Scotland see .
now here's Scotland .
and here's Ch(ina) As(ia) .
this is ?
this ?
and here's China .
wow that's far !
we have to cross probably the Atlantic ocean !
umm (.) the Pacific .
this big .
swim , swim , swim , swim
I was in William park .
and one day I see something floating in the water .
I was I want to have a closer look .
is it a
then I thought it was a beaver !
or something .
or something .
maybe I thought it was a beaver just swimming on the surface .
maybe not .
I think it was something else .
I think it have
it was little .
what ?
muskrat .
do they live here ?
I can't figure out (be)cause I want to reach him .
and just grab him onto onto the land .
I grab a rock as small get out of the water .
and probably would have pull me away !
mmhm .
this big .
about the size of a pig ?
oh .
that tall !
what ?
that's
huge .
yuck !
yes .
mmhm .
they're rolling in the mud .
and a lot of people keep seeing his neck .
out of the water .
there's a photo of one !
ones there's a photo of ones .
it was about a neck .
huh ?
uhhuh .
uhhuh .
those are briac briaciosaurous .
uhhuh .
but there's enough of it showing a flipper !
uhhuh .
then we probably think it's probably a pliasiasaurous .
it's .
was an underwater rap reptile .
people once thought it was a dinosaur .
but it's actually not .
it's it looks like this .
here's its neck .
it's this long .
here's the neck .
he was about this long .
his neck was this long .
here's the body .
he he have a short tail .
and see this is four four flippers .
uhhuh .
the scientists can't think pliasiasaurous did exist .
they they can't belive it what they see .
if I can catch one .
that would be perfect .
maybe after I catch this one .
mmhm .
that would be really cool .
-um yeah .
I'd put it in a duck swamp !
-um no .
I think I'll put a dam instead for him to swim in .
a big enough .
I need a boundary for him !
mmhm .
and I giant middle cage !
-um China .
it's prob(ably) in Asia .
and it's the largest contintent .
and you know (.) s r elephants also have relates .
the earlies elephant was called moeritherium .
uhhuh .
it was about the size of a pig .
I have prehistoric plant in my house .
and it show a moeritherium .
and it looks like a hippo .
mmm I don't think they actually live in China .
they're small .
es I knows s about some those (be)cause (be)cause my my dad well lives there .
he he can't come with me .
it it was about the size of a large pig .
it was about this long .
about this long actually .
and and it could swim in the water .
s see have paddles right here on the front leg .
dede they probably do owl elephant paddles like today's .
basilasaurus .
bas basilasaurus .
and he got on dry land .
and basilasaurus made the tide come in .
and he attacks .
and boom .
and he gots stuck in the sand .
he got in .
then they evolved bigger .
hm: they were something called palinpondon .
mmm have you heard of deinotherium before ?
it's another elephant .
it have tusks curved backwards !
mmhm .
into into that the little house thingie .
and and and I could show you where the elephant evolve s evolution .
you can see the what deinotheriums looks like .
well they're actually very grumpy , okay ?
they won't share their territory with any other animal .
mmm .
so one one deinotherium was attacking our ancestor got called astropicaficious .
just look at cham chimpanzee .
but only walk upright .
they already know how to walk upright , okay ?
mmm and and I know a show on tv called the Backyardins .
so Pablos , Tyron , Unequa , and Tasha .
and Tasha say there's no such thing .
(be)cause he's an expert into Northwest .
-uh where do yiddies live ?
North .
Northern Russia .
ahaha .
uhhuh .
do we have the tallest mountain ?
uhhuh .
and and one scientist s saw can't belive his eyes what is he saw .
there were two things (.) walking .
in the snow .
he just can't believe it .
like ghosts .
they can probably disappear .
and they appear again .
and disappear again , again , again .
that's so boring .
what ?
uhhuh .
Chinese .
mmm I -uh I I don't know the Chinese actually .
uhhuh .
-um -uh I'm too embarressed to say , okay .
-um -uh -uh -um there's two names for braciosaurus .
but I I can't know which one's the right and which one's the wrong .
-um I don't know what's they .
I'll ask one after I see one .
I hope everybody will laugh at me after I say in school .
mmhm .
uhhuh .
-uh they were English words and Chinese word actually .
mmhm .
this is where he was born too .
mmhm .
it's big .
and we live in a big house .
and the first people I see was my mom and dad .
and then I see him .
(be)cause I was only get it from garage sale .
mmm garage sale in Canada .
(be)cause that time I only see my
I have a big pink bear too .
uhhuh .
but it was a little dirty (be)cause no time to live there .
long time ago .
-uh -um once .
uhhuh .
uhhuh .
there are more this .
I have an animal dictionary .
-um I can just -um look at them whenever I want .
mmhm .

but there's enough of it showing a flipper !
uhhuh .
then we probably think it's probably a pliasiasaurous .
it's .
was an underwater rap reptile .
people once thought it was a dinosaur .
but it's actually not .
it's it looks like this .
here's its neck .
it's this long .
here's the neck .
he was about this long .
his neck was this long .
here's the body .
he he have a short tail .
and see this is four four flippers .
uhhuh .
the scientists can't think pliasiasaurous did exist .
they they can't belive it what they see .
if I can catch one .
that would be perfect .
maybe after I catch this one .
mmhm .
that would be really cool .
-um yeah .
I'd put it in a duck swamp !
-um no .
I think I'll put a dam instead for him to swim in .
a big enough .
I need a boundary for him !
mmhm .
and I giant middle cage !
-um China .
it's prob(ably) in Asia .
and it's the largest contintent .
and you know (.) s r elephants also have relates .
the earlies elephant was called moeritherium .
uhhuh .
it was about the size of a pig .
I have prehistoric plant in my house .
and it show a moeritherium .
and it looks like a hippo .
mmm I don't think they actually live in China .
they're small .
es I knows s about some those (be)cause (be)cause my my dad well lives there .
he he can't come with me .
it it was about the size of a large pig .
it was about this long .
about this long actually .
and and it could swim in the water .
s see have paddles right here on the front leg .
dede they probably do owl elephant paddles like today's .
basilasaurus .
bas basilasaurus .
and he got on dry land .
and basilasaurus made the tide come in .
and he attacks .
and boom .
and he gots stuck in the sand .
he got in .
then they evolved bigger .
hm: they were something called palinpondon .
mmm have you heard of deinotherium before ?
it's another elephant .
it have tusks curved backwards !
mmhm .
into into that the little house thingie .
and and and I could show you where the elephant evolve s evolution .
you can see the what deinotheriums looks like .
well they're actually very grumpy , okay ?
they won't share their territory with any other animal .
mmm .
so one one deinotherium was attacking our ancestor got called astropicaficious .
just look at cham chimpanzee .
but only walk upright .
they already know how to walk upright , okay ?
mmm and and I know a show on tv called the Backyardins .
so Pablos , Tyron , Unequa , and Tasha .
and Tasha say there's no such thing .
(be)cause he's an expert into Northwest .
-uh where do yiddies live ?
North .
Northern Russia .
ahaha .
uhhuh .
do we have the tallest mountain ?
uhhuh .
and and one scientist s saw can't belive his eyes what is he saw .
there were two things (.) walking .
in the snow .
he just can't believe it .
like ghosts .
they can probably disappear .
and they appear again .
and disappear again , again , again .
that's so boring .
what ?
uhhuh .
Chinese .
mmm I -uh I I don't know the Chinese actually .
uhhuh .
-um -uh I'm too embarressed to say , okay .
-um -uh -uh -um there's two names for braciosaurus .
but I I can't know which one's the right and which one's the wrong .
-um I don't know what's they .
I'll ask one after I see one .
I hope everybody will laugh at me after I say in school .
mmhm .

cat !
well I like turtles .
mmhm .
they have a hard shell .
almost nothing could attack it .
shell .
mmhm .
(be)cause if even even the strongest teef couldn't break that .
especially like the Galopis turtles .
sh shell are heavy than most of theirs .
Galapagos .
uhhuh .
I never heard of them .
sometime only .
the Galapagos tur(tle) tortoise was the biggest land tortoise ever .
(be)cause I saw on it before .
uhhuh .
uhhuh .
no .
I saw it on tv actually .
uhhuh .
and they were huge !
humong(ous) it was about this big shell .
its neck it stretch about this long .
and legs are this long .
and its tail was this long actually .
that's how big it is .
mmhm .
if I don't mind .
I could just relax on it for awhile .
mmhm .
mmhm .
I could just relax for a little while .
only if he doesn't go in the water .
and dump me off his back !
mmhm .
I like polar bears too .
it's the biggest predator in the arctic .
mmhm .
and I like the way the hunt some seals .
hm: they eat almost anything .
mmhm .
I got some(thing) .
hm: fo .
that's for blending in colours .
well I mean my mother teach me , you see .
kangaroos .

uhhuh .
that's actually it doesn't actually very hard .
they're just having fun .
-um joeys .
yup !
seals .
see they just just bite each other .
uhhuh .
(be)cause there's probably blubber in
there's under a thick fat called bludder bludder .
blubber .
sometimes I get mixed up up the words .
uhhuh .
and see its actually its claws are not that sharp .
so one hit -uh won't actually be that hurt .
uhhuh .
foxes .
some aren't .
some are different .
this this is the red fox .
probably grey and white .
like the arctic fox .
and actually related to dogs .
relat(ed) .
mmhm .
they act like one .
mmm half skunk .
and these are all of black bears or whistle in the water !
brown bears .
Alaska brown bears .
there's also called grizzly bears .
mmm just (be)cause if they're brown .
mmm people said if you played dead .
mmm he I think you can play dead .
bears won't attack you when you're dead .
uhhuh .
uhhuh .
don't just breathe , okay ?
just don't breathe .
and then it go away .
that's a chimpan(zee) chimpanzee .
mmm .
-uh well I think that is from the sunlight .
it just looks like a human .
I can't tell
probably
the lion's club cubs .
you know my favourite animal is is k is the killer whales .
no they're not !
that's some
probably .
let me see .
will not hurt the cubs .
actually .
between their teeth .
and just carry them to somewhere .
no .
they won't .
I think they they just got born somehow .
just waddled .
mmm this one .
see .
and th th the li the lion is like the crawl crawl on her .
and and bit her gentily .
one curious cub even put his paw in the lioness's mouth !
and will not hurt these guys , okay ?
I like killer whales (be)cause (be)cause they only eat everything .
that's a baby brown bear .
snow .
that's a baboon .
and this a wolf .
and but but my most favourite animal is the blue whale .
it's the largest animal of the world .
that's a wolf .
-uh -um -um actually the wolf hold the -um -um
I can't really s tell .
they looks almost just like each other .
they they're an ancenstors of dogs .
once in in the past .
there were no dogs .
uhhuh so .
and the early dogs live in trees .
soon the wolves got up the trees .
but actually the early foxes still living on trees actually .
now they're probably not .
and I'll show you -um this the seal .
their body .
okay .
that's all of this (.) pic(ture) .
uhhuh .
-um my mom buy it .
oops .
boing .
I also have a bunny .
nig nig nog .
well we they're all friends .
we just having
yes .
mmhm .
mmm this name ?
his -um name is David .
m m m .
that I put it actually back in so .
so I think
and his name is Sam .
mmhm .
I named them by myself .
first I thought one name in Al(ly) Ally .
but then acutally actually his name is Ally (be)cause of this .
Ally .
his name is Ally .
(...) three .
-uh (...) eight .
mmhm .
October the thirteenth .
mmhm .
mmm yeah .
mmm I I I went to celebrate at my friend's house .
we just played .
play .
mmm just one .
I just went to one friend's house .
-uh not too far .
we play something .
hm: we play dinosaurs .
he has some dinosaurs there but not as many as mine .
we just get some and grr .
grr .
mmhm .
they are one of my favourite an(imals) .
(be)cause a lot of them are huge !
mmm some of them ate plants and some of them ate meat .
just like today's animals !
mmm espec(ially) well the only different (be)cause is they have no fur .
(be)cause they're reptiles .
they're extinct giant lizards .
they means terrible giant lizard .
mmhm .
no !
they're extinct .
it means they probably die .
they died .
uhhuh all of them .
-um -um the sciences still didn't find out yet .
they there are many theories theories .
yeah theories .
I can't get the words right sometimes .
theories .
there's some theories .
a lot of theory .
one is a giant asteroid crashed the earth .
and just blocked the dust .
so the dinosaurs can't eat everything .
only they die .
then they will probably kill each other for some food .
they won't have enough things .
another one is just the world got too cold or too hot for the dinosaurs to live .
-uh probably the weather changed .
probably the ice age were gonna come .
well another theories was was about this you know .
it's there were small mammals of at that times .
and they probably just steal the dinosaurs eggs to eat .
mmhm .
that's probably for killing .
that means the won't
but actually I don't know
that's that's for the e .
the animals will eat the dinosaurs eggs .
hm: my my grandpa told me it was about volcanoes !
volcano blast !
and the lava just just went down .
and probably burned the plants and was the dinosaurs .
they just burned down .
and some maybe drown in rivers .
ah !
I don't know .
uhhuh .
he says the dinosaur's extinction was about s
a long time ago there's something called lava .
it have a kind of poison gas .
sees how a volcano is blasts out a poison gas .
and it'll go down into the grass .
that's how he say it .
and the eggs they were
they laid on
can't can't hatch baby dinosaurs .
I don't think I believe that .
that's a new theor(y) theories .
(be)cause I scientist in China found found dinosaur eggs .
and break the shell and sees there's something in it .
some scientists said probably some dinosaurs evolved into birds .
-uh birds are the closest ancestors of of of of dinosaurs .
(be)cause (be)cause a early bird called called
it starts with a a .
it's called ar ar .
probably start with a a .
and I forgot the name .
hm: it was a bird .
and it was the earliest bird ever .
but it's actually a reptile with wings .
(be)cause it's skeleton just looked just like a dinosaur skeleton .
and unlike today's birds they have teeth !
well one has .
they they just swollow !
they doesn't ch chew .
mmm they just grab it and just gulp .
glup .
they just swallow it .
mmhm .
mmhm .
I can also know some monsters .
but I don't think they actually do exist .
but there's three a lot of beasts like stuff .
but there's three kinds of monsters that I cannot stand .
most of them doesn't exist .
everybody s keeping seeing them .
uhhuh .
-uh they're
it's it's white .
and it's hairy and .
and it walk in the snow .
sometimes we called it a aomible snowman .
yeah .
abominable snowman .
abominable snowman .
and they leave footprints .
mmhm .
I no .
what is it about ?
monsters .
oh .
and they want to get this world ?
oh huh ?
huh ?
probably that's true !
uhhuh .
(be)cause maybe they kick out .
they probably just from outer space or somewhere .
they got here probably by a spaceship .
yeah .
because everybody keeps seeing them .
the (.) sasquatches .
like the bigfoots .
in China there's a lot .
one one one people have photo of one .
they walk just like a human !
and they saw one .
-uh just another su someone saw see it .
no .
because I don't live in the forest .
mmhm .
mmhm .
no -um no .
why ?
-um Alberta .
yeah .
ah !
in Vancouver ?
mmhm .
ah ah .
mmhm .
ah !
sasquatches right here ?
do they eat people ?
I
mmhm .
that would be great !
maybe I can get front row tickets for for the amusement park .
mmm .
mmm mmm and there was someone else (.) see seeing it .
a girl who was about to go home .
and it's mother .
they they they killed the monster .
and just cut off his hands and foot .
and bring it to the museum .
and we just think it's one of them .
for the bigfoot .
they live in Scotnow Scotland .
do you know where Scotland is ?
oh it's in Europe ?
ah !
it's close to Asia !
oh .
mmhm .
Scotland see .
now here's Scotland .
and here's Ch(ina) As(ia) .
this is ?
this ?
and here's China .
wow that's far !
we have to cross probably the Atlantic ocean !
umm (.) the Pacific .
this big .
swim , swim , swim , swim
I was in William park .
and one day I see something floating in the water .
I was I want to have a closer look .
is it a
then I thought it was a beaver !
or something .
or something .
maybe I thought it was a beaver just swimming on the surface .
maybe not .
I think it was something else .
I think it have
it was little .
what ?
muskrat .
do they live here ?
I can't figure out (be)cause I want to reach him .
and just grab him onto onto the land .
I grab a rock as small get out of the water .
and probably would have pull me away !
mmhm .
this big .
about the size of a pig ?
oh .
that tall !
what ?
that's
huge .
yuck !
yes .
mmhm .
they're rolling in the mud .
and a lot of people keep seeing his neck .
out of the water .
there's a photo of one !
ones there's a photo of ones .
it was about a neck .
huh ?
uhhuh .
uhhuh .
those are briac briaciosaurous .
uhhuh .
but there's enough of it showing a flipper !
uhhuh .
then we probably think it's probably a pliasiasaurous .
it's .
was an underwater rap reptile .
people once thought it was a dinosaur .
but it's actually not .
it's it looks like this .
here's its neck .
it's this long .

sorry but I don't like Barbie .
I had the best clothes in the world .
what ?
what ?
yeah .
lot .
I don't like winter clothes .
I mean it's like so thick that it keeps you like really hot .
sweaters are okay .
but I like summer clothes better .
(be)cause I have more summers than winters .
I think .
plus in summer
and halters and stuff .
but in winter .
you know it's freezing outside .
unless you just came from the typical tropical places .
I did art .
I had music .
I had violin lessons .
-um for our stain(ed) glass .
it's that -um -um a piece of white paper .
for everyone first it's a candle with flames .
and a little fancy holder thingy .
and two pieces of black con construction paper under it .
but you can't have a construction paper cook it .
you'll know why in a minute .
and first we used an e exacto knife .
to cut the little edges of the paper .
to cut the black parts out .
-um the white and construction one .
and then -um when we're finished cutting .
we have two pieces exactly the same .
construc(tion) black construction paper , right ?
so then we glue tissue paper on .
and and
then you put the other black one on it .
so now you can't see any of the glued pieces .
now now the the the the glued ones are sorta like wrinkling up .
our teacher used the
(o)kay what's it called ?
something laminator .
yeah .
that's it .
that's what I'm looking for .
and then now they're on the courtyard windows .
yeah .
yeah .
now I'm starting on my candy cane .
mmhm .
stain(ed) glass .
next
Christmas well
over the vacations .
and maybe in the school for -uh the second last or last school week .
we have some Christmas parties .
-um next week on Wednesday I have one at my violin lessons .
and then (.) next week's Friday I have one at my school .
as usual .
we decorate a Christmas tree .
put presents under it .
for each other .
yeah I have them right here .
one's behind the sofa .
but daddy knows that he's not supposed to look .
nope .
yep .
in a bag upstairs .
it spilled out so she saw .
well if I find something else suitable for her I'll get it .
eventually .
yeah .
at our school Christmas store .
yeah .
-um it's like for maybe Monday to Friday .
in somewhere in a part of the school .
-um p parents order stuff .
and then they put tables on it .
and then they put the stuff on it .
i -uh and little tags in front standing up sayin(g) how much it costs .
but first .
before the Christmas store .
like a week or so .
in the teachers' room .
and like there's a display window .
they show everything what they're going to sell .
so -um so the children could like see what and then know what they're going to get .
no .
yeah .
both .
you get free candy on both .
yeah .
when are we getting a Christmas tree ?
still in the basement .
yeah .
sometimes .

and and
then you put the other black one on it .
so now you can't see any of the glued pieces .
now now the the the the glued ones are sorta like wrinkling up .
our teacher used the
(o)kay what's it called ?
something laminator .

Christmas well
over the vacations .
and maybe in the school for -uh the second last or last school week .

eventually .
yeah .
at our school Christmas store .
yeah .
-um it's like for maybe Monday to Friday .
in somewhere in a part of the school .
-um p parents order stuff .
and then they put tables on it .
and then they put the stuff on it .
i -uh and little tags in front standing up sayin(g) how much it costs .
but first .
before the Christmas store .
like a week or so .
in the teachers' room .
and like there's a display window .
they show everything what they're going to sell .
so -um so the children could like see what and then know what they're going to get .

n ih .
sorry but I don't like Barbie .
I had the best clothes in the world .
what ?
what ?
yeah .
lot .
I don't like winter clothes .
I mean it's like so thick that it keeps you like really hot .
sweaters are okay .
but I like summer clothes better .
(be)cause I have more summers than winters .
I think .
plus in summer
and halters and stuff .
but in winter .
you know it's freezing outside .
unless you just came from the typical tropical places .
I did art .
I had music .
I had violin lessons .
-um for our stain(ed) glass .
it's that -um -um a piece of white paper .
for everyone first it's a candle with flames .
and a little fancy holder thingy .
and two pieces of black con construction paper under it .
but you can't have a construction paper cook it .
you'll know why in a minute .
and first we used an e exacto knife .
to cut the little edges of the paper .
to cut the black parts out .
-um the white and construction one .
and then -um when we're finished cutting .
we have two pieces exactly the same .
construc(tion) black construction paper , right ?
so then we glue tissue paper on .
and and
then you put the other black one on it .
so now you can't see any of the glued pieces .
now now the the the the glued ones are sorta like wrinkling up .
