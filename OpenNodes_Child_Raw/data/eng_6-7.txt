The Very Hungry Caterpillar .
in the light of the moon a little egg lay (.) on a leaf .
one Sunday morning the warm sun came up and pop out of the egg came a tiny and very hungry caterpillar .
he started to look for some food .
on Monday he ate through one apple (.) but he was still hungry .
on Tuesday he ate through two pears but he was still hungry .
on Wednesday he ate through three plums (.) but he was still hungry .
on Thursday he ate through four strawberries (.) but he was still hungry .
on Friday he ate through five oranges (.) but he was still hungry .
on Saturday he ate through one piece of chocolate cake (.) one icecream cone (.) one pickle (.) a slice of Swiss cheese (.) one slice of salami (.) one lollipop (.) one piece of cherry pie (.) one sausage (.) one cupcake (.) and one slice of watermelon .
I mean the next day was Sunday again .
the caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf (.) and after that he felt much better .
-uh .
now he wasn't (.) hungry anymore (.) and he wasn't little a little caterpillar anymore .
he was a big (.) fat caterpillar .
he built a small house called a cocoon around himself .
he stayed inside for (.) more than two weeks .
then he nibbled (.) a hole in the cocoon (.) pushed his way out and
he was a beautiful butterfly !

the kids are helping the father make the the the cake .
and then one of the kids are holding a glass of water (.) pouring it in while the father just cracked the egg and let the yolk out .
the other boy was holding a bowl that they just used .
and that's about it .
well
I know that !
mm there's a kid walking up the steps .
and a kid is sliding down and gotta the end .
and a kid is swinging on a donkey swing while the father is pushing .
and there's some trees and I see a bench that's round .
and there's gates .
and that's about all I see except for the grass around the trees .
a a spoon .
and and there's a bag .
and there's a box that you hold fries in .
and a fork .
and there's a thing that you hold eggs in .
and there's a cup .
and and and that thing that you put on tacos .
and a napkin .
and a straw .
and another bag .
for the fries .
and there's a McDonalds thing .
mhm .
mhm .
so these are all things we get where Mat ?
from McDonalds .
because I drive by beside McDonalds .
mhm .
oh you're so neat .
no (.) that would go last .
do you have something else ?
first you walk in .
and wait in line .
then you pay for the food .
after you ask what do you want .
then you sit down .
you eat your food .
then you clean everything off the the table .
then you walk out the door .
there's a towel .
and a comb .
a (.) powder .
mm shampoo .
and a toothbrush .
and there's a toothpaste .
the bathroom .
this goes
and the toothbrush goes on the soap .
and
can I get out
first (.) I gotta get these stuff out .
mhm .
come on , and play .
let (u)s go .
yes .
but I don't know when
I don't know which part to do .
and all of the animals fell down .
they're just going right into this
the the monkey started going right in there (.) can't come out .
well they don't want in their yard .
so they don't wanna be bugged .
you know disturbed or something .
so they can mind their own business .
then after the farmer kicked the monkey out of the farm
then he let all of the animals out .
then you do the rest (.) okay ?
that's right .
they can drink and eat and do all that they wanna do .
chicken .
now the chicken can come out if he wants to .
then it was all nighttime and all of the animals went back in .
then the end .
I liked your story Mat .
this time you do the first part and I'll do the rest .
the farm goes here .
the farm goes here .
the cow (ha)s been eating the cabbages .
but he doesn't eat so much .
the farmer is already starting to pick them because some of them are okay .
and this these gates are so that no animals will come and eat up all of the food (.) all those growing cabbages and all those berries that he's growing .
and she came milking the cow .
the monkey was doing his own business (.) just wandering around .
and mind if any animals mind that the animal came on their farm .
and the monkey went to get something to drink .
then when the farmer had so much to pick he called for his helper (.) to help him .
every time when the farmer picks eats one of the salad or berries then she takes the salad or the berries up in to the house .
so they'll be doing that .
ruff ruff the dog said .
ruff ruff .
and the doggy makes sure there is no other strange animals on their yard or he'll take care of it .
and the dog already sniffed out a strange looking footprint from a animal .
and he found out there was a monkey .
so the the dog chased him around and around the farmyard (.) the house one (.) you know .
and when they got all tired the monkey finally went away .
and and the next day the farm was all waking up .
the lamb came out too .
the other day it wasn't warm enough .
I mean the the maid was cutting off the woolsheep for the summertime .
and the dog was running around looking for some other animals to to find .
then the dog got tired and he took a drink .
then he found out the chicken's house wasn't closed enough so the dog was barking .
so he finally caught someone and (.) fixed it all up .
and he finally came back down .
and the farmer was milking the cow .
because the chicken lays plenty of eggs for the farmer .
and the horse (.) he was just eating
and over here is where the animals eat .
the horse eats the cabbage .
the lambs eat the grass .
and so does the cow eat grass .
so
and the dog eats very much .
the dog
and when the farmer was sprinkling seeds all over the road (.) the chicken found out so he went out of his nest to eat them .
then the chicken went up into his nest in the nighttime .
and the next day horse was giving a ride to the farmer .
giddyup giddyup .
and every day the horse helps the farmer get over the fence because there is so much and he can't even make it to get to the gate now so he can go over and pick up all of the food .
so very day the horse jumps over the gate with the farmer .
and he jumps back over .
the end .
well I got farm

mhm .
then when you put her tail in water it change colors .
and that's about it .
mm (.) first I picked out my earrings .
they were my birthstones .
then when they put the earrings in I was crying for because it hurt .
yes .
so
oh and mommy did the part (.) put Chlorox on it (.) you know the stuff that cleans off the dirt .
and then I turn the earrings .
but when it gets on the earring it gets slippery for me to turn it .

setting against the shore .

oh once there was Bob and he was going to the store from going home from school .
he saw this woman carrying letters to a mailbox .
and then he saw the woman blew the letters out in to the street .
and Bob found out .
then he looked both ways and saw no cars coming and he ran into the street and picked up all of the letters .
and the woman thanked Bob for being such a kind boy .
but why does it have no words ?

and then one of the kids are holding a glass of water (.) pouring it in while the father just cracked the egg and let the yolk out .
the other boy was holding a bowl that they just used .
and that's about it .
well
I know that !
mm there's a kid walking up the steps .
and a kid is sliding down and gotta the end .
and a kid is swinging on a donkey swing while the father is pushing .
and there's some trees and I see a bench that's round .
and there's gates .
and that's about all I see except for the grass around the trees .
a a spoon .
and and there's a bag .
and there's a box that you hold fries in .
and a fork .
and there's a thing that you hold eggs in .
and there's a cup .
and and and that thing that you put on tacos .
and a napkin .
and a straw .
and another bag .
for the fries .
and there's a McDonalds thing .
mhm .
mhm .
so these are all things we get where Mat ?
from McDonalds .
because I drive by beside McDonalds .
mhm .
oh you're so neat .
no (.) that would go last .
do you have something else ?
first you walk in .
and wait in line .
then you pay for the food .
after you ask what do you want .
then you sit down .
you eat your food .
then you clean everything off the the table .
then you walk out the door .
there's a towel .
and a comb .
a (.) powder .
mm shampoo .
and a toothbrush .
and there's a toothpaste .
the bathroom .
this goes
and the toothbrush goes on the soap .
and
can I get out
first (.) I gotta get these stuff out .
mhm .
come on , and play .
let (u)s go .
yes .
but I don't know when
I don't know which part to do .
and all of the animals fell down .
they're just going right into this
the the monkey started going right in there (.) can't come out .
well they don't want in their yard .
so they don't wanna be bugged .
you know disturbed or something .
so they can mind their own business .
then after the farmer kicked the monkey out of the farm
then he let all of the animals out .
then you do the rest (.) okay ?
that's right .
they can drink and eat and do all that they wanna do .
chicken .
now the chicken can come out if he wants to .
then it was all nighttime and all of the animals went back in .
then the end .
I liked your story Mat .
this time you do the first part and I'll do the rest .
the farm goes here .
the farm goes here .
the cow (ha)s been eating the cabbages .
but he doesn't eat so much .
the farmer is already starting to pick them because some of them are okay .
and this these gates are so that no animals will come and eat up all of the food (.) all those growing cabbages and all those berries that he's growing .
and she came milking the cow .
the monkey was doing his own business (.) just wandering around .
and mind if any animals mind that the animal came on their farm .
and the monkey went to get something to drink .
then when the farmer had so much to pick he called for his helper (.) to help him .
every time when the farmer picks eats one of the salad or berries then she takes the salad or the berries up in to the house .
so they'll be doing that .
ruff ruff the dog said .
ruff ruff .
and the doggy makes sure there is no other strange animals on their yard or he'll take care of it .
and the dog already sniffed out a strange looking footprint from a animal .
and he found out there was a monkey .
so the the dog chased him around and around the farmyard (.) the house one (.) you know .
and when they got all tired the monkey finally went away .
and and the next day the farm was all waking up .
the lamb came out too .
the other day it wasn't warm enough .
I mean the the maid was cutting off the woolsheep for the summertime .
and the dog was running around looking for some other animals to to find .
then the dog got tired and he took a drink .
then he found out the chicken's house wasn't closed enough so the dog was barking .
so he finally caught someone and (.) fixed it all up .
and he finally came back down .
and the farmer was milking the cow .
because the chicken lays plenty of eggs for the farmer .
and the horse (.) he was just eating
and over here is where the animals eat .
the horse eats the cabbage .
the lambs eat the grass .
and so does the cow eat grass .
so
and the dog eats very much .
the dog
and when the farmer was sprinkling seeds all over the road (.) the chicken found out so he went out of his nest to eat them .
then the chicken went up into his nest in the nighttime .
and the next day horse was giving a ride to the farmer .
giddyup giddyup .
and every day the horse helps the farmer get over the fence because there is so much and he can't even make it to get to the gate now so he can go over and pick up all of the food .
so very day the horse jumps over the gate with the farmer .
and he jumps back over .

and they lived happily ever after .
can you ?
here (i)s the rainbow (.) here (i)s the pot of gold (.) here (i)s the sun .

Max grabbed his fishing rod and went and got his dog Clifford .
he went to look over and what did he see (.) he saw big frog sitting on the lilypad .
when he ran he he didn't even notice the log .
and he tripped .
and head first (.) his dog and him .
and he tripped and the frog just sat there and looked at him .
and then he hopped away .
I forget the first part .
one day Bob was walking home from school .
he saw a woman carrying letters to her mailbox .
what he did was he saw the woman .
suddenly the wind blew .
the wind blew mm her her letters .
and mm he looked both ways .
he didn't see any cars .
and then he went in to the street (.) got her letters and gave them back to her .
mm and that was very helpful .
okay .
Max and Pero were sitting in the room but when they looked in the jar all they saw was a green frog .
but when they went to bed the frog got out .
and whenever he woke up again his frog was gone .
they looked everywhere but they couldn't find him .
while the dog (.) you should have saw him (.) he dropped the jar on his head (.) the poor poor thing .
well Max and Myro jumped off but Max jumped over so he could get his dog .
and whenever he looked under
whenever the chipmunk came out he went like whoop .
ouch .
but Max climbed the tree to find his frog .
I mean
what (i)s his name ?
what did Pero find ?
Pero saw a bunch of flies .
I mean a bunch of bees coming after him .
and he ran so fast that they couldn't sting his little but .
but whenever he got there he bumped in to a tree .
and climbed all the way off .
but whenever he was gonna jump off the rock
well he got on the deer's head and ran away .
and they felled right off the edge .
and they almost got sick .
it (i)s a good think they they couldn't find the frog .
but the frog was in its cage .
they didn't get to find it .
but they they almost found Max and
and (.) Max and Pero
it (i)s a good thing they found him because Pero
the frog's name is John .
and they all lived happily ever after .

yeah yeah yeah s d m the China m moms and dads .
w and when a child sit next to them .

cats are my favourite animal of all .
w w w well I got a black cat costume .
for Halloween .
yeah .
and if someone doesn't give treats to you .
you trick them .
yeah .
when they don't give them your treat .
you if if they don't give you a treat .
you have to trick them .
that's the only way if they don't give you a treat .
when is the Halloween s thing ?
e a y y well well when Halloween comes you have to go out .
and go house to house .
if you get any candy .
you don't have to trick them .
and if you don't get candy .
you'll y you'll have to trick trick them .
then you can go on to the next house .
yeah .
I haven't thought of any yet .
yeah .
yeah it is on Sunday .
so I only have two more days to think about it .
yeah .
I like to pretend I'm a dinosaur .
but the only thing is .
I don't have a dinosaur costume .
or maybe I should pretend I'm a cat .
I could meow .
that's how I would trick them .
p and I'll pretend my hands and feet are claws by doing this .
last year .
but I was wearing that the same thing last year .
next year I'll still get a cat .
it's the white cat next year .

I'll have to find another book about cats in my bookshelf .
okay .
yeah .
I I here's another one from my sch(ool) .
here's a book from my school's library .
this is not about cats .
but it's about volcanoes .
a volcano is a mountain .
yeah .
it's a very dangerous mountain .
no .
because what if it explodes ?
if it explodes it will just go all the way down the volcano .
you would die .
yeah .
that's why you k can't
yeah .
you can't go near a volcano .
okay .
okay okay okay there are contents about this book .
a vol(cano)
this ?

magma .
and this i
which which is the lava .
it goes up here .
