(.) in the light of the moon a little egg laid on a leaf .
one Sunday morning the warm sun came up and pop out of the egg came a tiny and very hungry caterpillar .
(.) star (.) stared (.) starting to look for food .
one m Monday he ate (.) through one apple but he was still hungry .
on Tuesday he ate through two pears but he was still hungry .
on Wednesday he ate through three plums but he was still hungry .
on Thursday he ate through four strawberries but he was still hungry .
on Friday he ate through five oranges but he was still hungry .
on Saturday he ate through one piece of chocolate cake one icecream cone one pickle on slice of swiss cheese one slice of salami one lollipop one piece of cherry pie one sausage one cupcake and one slice of watermelon .
that night he had a stomachache .
I wonder why .
the next (.) Sunday again caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf and after that he felt much better .
now he wasn't hungry anymore .
and he wasn't a little caterpillar anymore .
he was a big fat caterpillar .
he built a small house called a cocoon around himself (.) stayed inside for more than two weeks .

we have beets in our garden
hopefully they'll grow as big as that
I see a nice you know like a nice little like -um wooden fence
mhm
well I only like reading
Archie , I think that's what his name is
two at a time?
well I kinda tie it differently than most people would

two mips
well he no
-um there's also like like a dragon fly .

Miss

Grandma showed me how .
I think I've hit all of them
and I'd probably do it two times a day .
I would probably do like the
not like the top and bottom of your teeth and then do like the front of your teeth and the back and sometimes you I feel like people
someone once said like that it's good to brush your tongue or something and like the roof of your tongue .
-um and then I'd dry my hands off like a paper towel and then like shake them off
and I'd probably tie mine like it's hard to explain how to tie your shoes
and I'd probably like
do they put on the shirt , put on underwear , put on pants , wait no put on socks , then pants , and then that's how I'd do that .
I'd probably like put milk in , -um flour .
and like a bunch of other stuff .
and then I'd -um cook it in like the oven or something .

-um so a boy he was out scuba diving
and now they're doing experiments on rats and the rats wanted
and -um the squid's trying to look for the rats with a magnifying glass
and -um the boy is trying to hold up a lightbulb cause the power went off to

someone once said like that it's good to brush your tongue or something and like the roof of your tongue .
-um and then I'd dry my hands off like a paper towel and then like shake them off
and I'd probably tie mine like it's hard to explain how to tie your shoes
and I'd probably like
do they put on the shirt , put on underwear , put on pants , wait no put on socks , then pants , and then that's how I'd do that .

I want you to write it .
in the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf .
(.) he started to look for some food .
on Monday he ate through one apple but he was still hungry .
on Tuesday he ate through two pears but he was still hungry .
on Wednesday he ate through three plums (.) but he was still hungry .
on Thursday he ate through four strawberries (.) but he was still hungry .
on Friday he ate through five oranges (.) but he was still hungry .
(.) sounds like me !
on Saturday he ate through one piece of chocolate cake (.) one icecream cone (.) one pickle (.) one slice of Swiss cheese (.) one slice of salami (.) one lollipop (.) one piece of cherry pie (.) one sausage (.) one cupcake (.) and one slice of watermelon .
that night he had a stomachache .
(.) the next day was Sunday again .
the caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf (.) and after (.) that he felt much better .
now he wasn't hungry any anymore (.) and he wasn't a little caterpillar anymore .
he was a big fat caterpillar .
he built a small house called a cocoon around himself .
he stayed inside for more than two weeks .

I like your book because it was funny .

the caterpillar sounded like me (be)cause I like to eat .
I want you to write it .
in the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf .
(.) he started to look for some food .
on Monday he ate through one apple but he was still hungry .
on Tuesday he ate through two pears but he was still hungry .
on Wednesday he ate through three plums (.) but he was still hungry .
on Thursday he ate through four strawberries (.) but he was still hungry .
on Friday he ate through five oranges (.) but he was still hungry .
(.) sounds like me !
on Saturday he ate through one piece of chocolate cake (.) one icecream cone (.) one pickle (.) one slice of Swiss cheese (.) one slice of salami (.) one lollipop (.) one piece of cherry pie (.) one sausage (.) one cupcake (.) and one slice of watermelon .
that night he had a stomachache .
(.) the next day was Sunday again .
the caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf (.) and after (.) that he felt much better .
now he wasn't hungry any anymore (.) and he wasn't a little caterpillar anymore .
he was a big fat caterpillar .
