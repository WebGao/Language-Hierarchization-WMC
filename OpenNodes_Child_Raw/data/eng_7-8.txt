and sometimes they talk about vampires .
and sometimes they even talk about ghost and I'm not scared .
it's
because it's not that bad .
no .
but one time there was a ghost .
it was so freaky .
because there was this old house .
and these kids .
like these two four kids were sleeping .
and then -um something fell .
and no one touched it .
not even one .
mmm .

-uh no that he got it .
that time I didn't get no books !
no books !
every single time my mom and dad did not let me .
because I used to be in the same school but they were a little bit cheaper .
that's why .
but now they got lower price .

yeah .
yeah .
this is my favourite part about school .
the parts

but my dad wants me to get homework .
it's such a bad thing .
-uh I don't like practicing reading .
-uh I like it for practicing you just watch tv .
-uh when once my dad doesn't like this part .
once I go -um -um .
my dad doesn't like when I watch television because I stay on television too long .
because I watch like te .
look .
when I get home from school .
I go verom verom .
and turn turn off the tv .

yeah !
and -um there v a funny guy .
and he a dog .
and he can talk .
yeah .
not the movie but I seen Shrek the movie .
out of every show ?
but I'm not sure against these three .
I'm not sure .
he -um invents stuff and then (.)
like here .
I'll tell you one of the shows .
-um -uh in one of the shows .
because they were leaving to somewhere else .
but but -um then his friends came over .
they had a party .
and they called everyone in town (.) to have a party .
except the mom and dad .
they got so bored right away .
and then this guy want
and oh but that's not the funniest show .
no .
Spongebob is the funniest one .
he's funny because he does funny things .
-um he says -um .
which one should I tell you ?
-uh which one ?
which one ?
Spongebob Squarepant ?
because he a sponge (.) first of all .
yeah he's a
yeah because he wears pants .
no .
yeah .
that's his name .
that's his middle name .
and -uh (.) I like Beyblades because -um it's it's kinda it's kinda have like cool monster in it .
do you know what ?
my friend -um he was different friend .
he do you which one he said he would pick ?
he would pick the one that I wouldn't ever pick .
chicks .
this one .
that would be for babies .
no one would ever pick that one .
no .
I don't think no one .
okay .
but that's only for counting .
here .
I'll tell you the ones that nobody would ever get .
no one would ever get this one .
or no one would ever get -um (...) .
which one no one would ever get
oh that one .
oh no one would ever get this one .
because because -um -um our -um -um -um school .
only is up to kindergarten .
so why should they have these books .
and
okay .
yeah .
maybe you're smarter than me .
okay I'm not so smart .
okay .
this one .
this one .
this one .
yeah .
I don't like math .
subject ?
mat(h) .
no , no , no .
not math .
because I'm good at it .
in science ?
-uh because last year I got a a on science every time .
yeah and
but no not so much .
but I didn't get everything perfect .
mat(h) I always got a f .
because I don't like math that part .
what part of math is hard ?
the -uh high numbers .
because last year we had to do high high numbers .
high numbers like between -um twenty and eleven .
twenty and eleven .
we got to do high number .
I wish I just did -um -um low number .
yeah .
and today we we we had to do math .
but guess what .
I'm lucky (be)cause our our teacher changed it into gym .
no .
gym class .
we we played freeze tag and we played turtle tag .
because -um when someone tags you .
you have to go like a turtle .
and someone has to touch your foot .
and then you're free again .
freeze tag ?
oh -um -um when someone tags you .
-um you have to freeze .
and then someone has to go under you .
to unfreeze you .
well that's what we played .
do you know which group was it was in for freeze tag ?
there was only one game of freeze tag .
and my friend was it .
and another girl was it .
yeah .
I don't know her name though .
like almost like fif(teen) .
not too much like fifteen .
yeah .
yeah .
and we have to try to tag all of them .
and d d one time (.) last year .
when we went to gym .
I I tagged the the h h half of the class .
half of the class .
yeah I tagged half of the class .
s some more people were helping me .
so we almost got the whole class .
we we I didn't know tha that we got the whole class .
but then there was only missing .
but then -um -um he tagged another one .
and then then they keep kept running .
and then so it was hard to get after .
yeah .
but not not not as fast as my neighbour .
everybody here I'll tell you a secret .
everybody here is a bad bad kid .
a bad kid .
they do bad stuff .
no I don't .
yeah .
yeah .
they say bad words .
no .
they they -um hit people .
yeah .
no .
yeah .
and -um but they never hit me because I I don't go outside so much .
they like going outside lots .
so I stay inside .
yeah .
because there a bully here .
a boy .
they're not not next door .
someone way over there .
but he never sees me so .
he might think that like I'm moved to a new house .
well today I think I can go out .
because look (.) no one is
yeah .
no one out .
yeah .
because they can beat me up .
they would too !
would too !
-uh .
-uh -uh I am not sure .
I think I'm gonna would be -uh -uh -uh wai .
-uh no .
-um -uh I think I'll be -uh scientist .
good job ?
I I hope there's still some fossils left .
that I can dig in .
I hope .
yeah .
but it can't .
my dream was that I -um I wish that dinosaurs were alive .
but it can't come true .
because .
they were alive before .
they died !
yeah .
yeah .
because there was this bomb .
that crushed this one .
and it the other one went all the way to the earth .
and there was no more plants .
and once they ate it .
and there was no more .
then they -um they die .
(be)cause there was no more dinosaurs to eat ?
hid under a rock ?
they -um they needed other like plant .
so that .
yeah .
so that's why they died out .
million years ago .
nope .
yeah .
yeah .
and (.) what else ?
yeah .
because he's big and strong and mighty .
yeah .
huh ?
I don't know .
maybe it they they are extinct .
what my friend told me .
that they are extinct .
but like in dark , dark , dark trees .
-um -um they h he says that dinosaurs are still in there .
so you might probably break a tree and and get it .
but the thing is they won't remember how to do anything .
yeah .
they won't remember how to walk .
they won't even remember how to walk .
from such long time .
oh and it wouldn't be a good idea to get them .
because they will eat all the plant .
and finish with all of the plant .
oh yeah .
pretty hopeless .
yeah .
because everybody would die .
okay .
yeah .
hey cool .
oh cool .
he wants to give me a ride .
cool .
-uh no .
that would be so cool if he gave me a ride .
and and then -um if he was my pet .
and and kill the bully .
yeah .
and they die .
yeah .
Colombia .
yeah .
it's nice and hot .
no too so hot as this is .
yeah .
four year ago .
I wish we could move to a new house .
yeah .
no .
not soo much .
it's nice and warm and I get to feel it right now .
ah .
yeah the nice hot sun .
yeah .
they even send me a video .
yeah .
my family (.) was on the video .
I've a big , big family .
like (.) fifteen .
no fifty .
fifty .
because it it's with my mom's family and with my dad's family .
so they can connect all together .
yeah .
and -um -um I was dreaming that -um they came to Canada .
why why is it always me ?
me , me , me ?
but and and this the the crazy part .
and and then -um -um we run .
first they use a lot of my mom and dad's money .
-um and then when we were out of money .
we went back home .
and got my piggy bank .
and we used all of that money .
and then we went to Zellers and bought all of the clothes .
yeah .
and then we only had one penny left .
on ?
nothing .
yep .
yeah .
and then we finally came .
and and all the the house .
you know how big it was ?
s it has like four -um bathrooms .
yeah .
it had four bathrooms .
four bathrooms .
and -um -um like eighteen eighteen -um eighteen .
yeah .
eighteen bedrooms .
and one kitchen .
yeah .
and all of the bedroom were upstairs .
-uh no .
one is upstair(s) .
there and we even got a basement .
yeah .
one was upstairs .
the other one was -uh downstairs .
and the other one was in the basement .
yeah .
mmm Spanish .
yeah .
because I took so much English .
yeah .
English .
because it's easier for me to speak .
yeah .
a little bit hard because I forget some of it .
yeah .
when when when we came to -uh Canada .
but finally we came .
yeah .
no .
do you see that thingie with -um the flagies ?
really .
-um -um r yellow , blue , and red .
that's our flag .
yeah .
and you you see that those dolls and ?
that's from Colombia (.) too .
yeah .
and someone even gave me like this long , long , long hat .
yeah .
a long hat .
yeah .
they made all of that by theirself .
yeah .
can you imagine ?
by theirself .
yeah .
they didn't buy it from a store .
no .
yeah .
can you imagine ?
building that ?
and building what else ?
did they .
-uh no .
they didn't build that .
they build -um
let me see .
something that they build -uh .
hey !
where is it ?
here is the painting that my mom used to draw .
but then she had to move .
and she forgot them .
mmm soccer .
because .
-um the sport only is on soccer .
they only have soccer .
they don't have no ice hockey .
because -um it only rains it never snowed there .
no it only rains .
in the winter it's funner .
there's some winter .
but instead of snow it rains .
so and sometimes and and in winter it rains too much that that it's clean water .
it drops clean water .
and we get to swim all over it .
it's so cool .
winter's so cool in Colombia .
(...) but it's not good here .
no here it's very chilly .
yeah .
you need like ten or fifteen people .
first -uh I don't know .
I think you should ask that question to my dad .
because he knows lots about soccer .
mmm you have to pass the ball to each other .
and because one time .
we were against this team that was arguing .
the other team that we were against one time .
somebody were not paying attention .
so we just took the ball away .
it was easy to score a goal on them .
yeah .
yeah .
when you put that on .
the camera goes on , right ?
oh cool .
soccer .
I'm number three .
-um -um -um that's because I'm one of the smallest .
yeah .
I'm always one the smallest .
I was the secondest smallest .
I'm always the second smallest !
no .
I wish I could be one of the biggest .
I don't like being small !
no .
well I'm good at school .
the thing is that I'm scared of the ball .
-um (be)cause when someone shoots the ball high .
I do like this .
becuase it hit me in the face really bad .
no .
that that would be a hand ball .
hand ball .
when people touch it .
you can't use your hands .
you can only use your foot .
no .
because .
it's not like volleyball .
-um you can only use your feet .
you cannot use your hands .
only the goalie can .
because because he he the one that needs to save the goal .
that's why .
yeah .
but we can't .
we need to do it with our feet .
-um when the ball's coming .
say this me .
so when the guy's coming with the ball I have to kick it away from him .
and pass it to another person .
run and kick it to another person .
no .
defence you cannot score a goal .
only forward .
no .
I cannot kick so high .
so don't I would never score a goal .
no .
because I'm always defence .
I like defence .
that's why .
-uh yeah .
this weekend ?
-uh I slept all day (.) I think .
no I didn't .
I what did I do ?
what did I do .
-um I can't remember anything .
(be)cause since I had a busy day today .
-um -um I can't remember anything .
because I'm so tired .
yeah .
okay .
yeah .
I even got one
no only boys do .
like who ?
and -um all of them are book .
and -uh .
and I got .
and no David .
I read this one .
he he kinda is a little bit funny .
he because he plays with his food .
yeah .
and he picks a gross thing .
he he picks his nose .
and he -um -um he -um opens with his mouth .
-um -um open .
ah what are you gonna see ?
oh yeah .
I know how to use this .
last time it kept falling and falling and falling .
yeah .
and which else book I got ?

and they called everyone in town (.) to have a party .
except the mom and dad .
they got so bored right away .
and then this guy want

and -uh (.) I like Beyblades because -um it's it's kinda it's kinda have like cool monster in it .
do you know what ?
my friend -um he was different friend .
he do you which one he said he would pick ?
he would pick the one that I wouldn't ever pick .
chicks .
this one .
that would be for babies .
no one would ever pick that one .
no .
I don't think no one .
okay .
but that's only for counting .
here .
I'll tell you the ones that nobody would ever get .
no one would ever get this one .
or no one would ever get -um (...) .
which one no one would ever get
oh that one .
oh no one would ever get this one .
because because -um -um our -um -um -um school .
only is up to kindergarten .
so why should they have these books .
and
okay .
yeah .
maybe you're smarter than me .
okay I'm not so smart .
okay .
this one .
this one .
this one .
yeah .
I don't like math .
subject ?
mat(h) .
no , no , no .
not math .
because I'm good at it .
in science ?
-uh because last year I got a a on science every time .
yeah and
but no not so much .
but I didn't get everything perfect .
mat(h) I always got a f .
because I don't like math that part .
what part of math is hard ?
the -uh high numbers .
because last year we had to do high high numbers .
high numbers like between -um twenty and eleven .
twenty and eleven .
we got to do high number .
I wish I just did -um -um low number .
yeah .
and today we we we had to do math .
but guess what .
I'm lucky (be)cause our our teacher changed it into gym .
no .
gym class .
we we played freeze tag and we played turtle tag .
because -um when someone tags you .
you have to go like a turtle .
and someone has to touch your foot .
and then you're free again .
freeze tag ?
oh -um -um when someone tags you .
-um you have to freeze .
and then someone has to go under you .
to unfreeze you .
well that's what we played .
do you know which group was it was in for freeze tag ?
there was only one game of freeze tag .
and my friend was it .
and another girl was it .
yeah .
I don't know her name though .
like almost like fif(teen) .
not too much like fifteen .
yeah .
yeah .
and we have to try to tag all of them .
and d d one time (.) last year .
when we went to gym .
I I tagged the the h h half of the class .
half of the class .
yeah I tagged half of the class .
s some more people were helping me .
so we almost got the whole class .
we we I didn't know tha that we got the whole class .
but then there was only missing .
but then -um -um he tagged another one .
and then then they keep kept running .
and then so it was hard to get after .
yeah .
but not not not as fast as my neighbour .
everybody here I'll tell you a secret .
everybody here is a bad bad kid .
a bad kid .
they do bad stuff .
no I don't .
yeah .
yeah .
they say bad words .
no .
they they -um hit people .
yeah .
no .
yeah .
and -um but they never hit me because I I don't go outside so much .
they like going outside lots .
so I stay inside .
yeah .
because there a bully here .
a boy .
they're not not next door .
someone way over there .
but he never sees me so .
he might think that like I'm moved to a new house .
well today I think I can go out .
because look (.) no one is
yeah .
no one out .
yeah .
because they can beat me up .
they would too !
would too !
-uh .
-uh -uh I am not sure .
I think I'm gonna would be -uh -uh -uh wai .
-uh no .
-um -uh I think I'll be -uh scientist .
good job ?
I I hope there's still some fossils left .
that I can dig in .
I hope .
yeah .
but it can't .
my dream was that I -um I wish that dinosaurs were alive .
but it can't come true .
because .
they were alive before .
they died !
yeah .
yeah .
because there was this bomb .
that crushed this one .
and it the other one went all the way to the earth .
and there was no more plants .
and once they ate it .
and there was no more .
then they -um they die .
(be)cause there was no more dinosaurs to eat ?
hid under a rock ?
they -um they needed other like plant .
so that .
yeah .
so that's why they died out .
million years ago .
nope .
yeah .
yeah .
and (.) what else ?
yeah .
because he's big and strong and mighty .
yeah .
huh ?
I don't know .
maybe it they they are extinct .
what my friend told me .
that they are extinct .
but like in dark , dark , dark trees .
-um -um they h he says that dinosaurs are still in there .
so you might probably break a tree and and get it .
but the thing is they won't remember how to do anything .
yeah .
they won't remember how to walk .
they won't even remember how to walk .
from such long time .
oh and it wouldn't be a good idea to get them .
because they will eat all the plant .
and finish with all of the plant .
oh yeah .
pretty hopeless .
yeah .
because everybody would die .
okay .
yeah .
hey cool .
oh cool .
he wants to give me a ride .
cool .
-uh no .
that would be so cool if he gave me a ride .
and and then -um if he was my pet .
and and kill the bully .
yeah .
and they die .
yeah .
Colombia .
yeah .
it's nice and hot .
no too so hot as this is .
yeah .
four year ago .
I wish we could move to a new house .
yeah .
no .
not soo much .
it's nice and warm and I get to feel it right now .
ah .
yeah the nice hot sun .
yeah .
they even send me a video .
yeah .
my family (.) was on the video .
I've a big , big family .
like (.) fifteen .
no fifty .
fifty .
because it it's with my mom's family and with my dad's family .
so they can connect all together .
yeah .
and -um -um I was dreaming that -um they came to Canada .
why why is it always me ?
me , me , me ?
but and and this the the crazy part .
and and then -um -um we run .
first they use a lot of my mom and dad's money .
-um and then when we were out of money .
we went back home .
and got my piggy bank .
and we used all of that money .
and then we went to Zellers and bought all of the clothes .
yeah .
and then we only had one penny left .
on ?
nothing .
yep .
yeah .
and then we finally came .
and and all the the house .
you know how big it was ?
s it has like four -um bathrooms .
yeah .
it had four bathrooms .
four bathrooms .
and -um -um like eighteen eighteen -um eighteen .
yeah .
eighteen bedrooms .
and one kitchen .
yeah .
and all of the bedroom were upstairs .
-uh no .
one is upstair(s) .
there and we even got a basement .
yeah .
one was upstairs .
the other one was -uh downstairs .
and the other one was in the basement .
yeah .
mmm Spanish .
yeah .
because I took so much English .
yeah .
English .
because it's easier for me to speak .
yeah .
a little bit hard because I forget some of it .
yeah .
when when when we came to -uh Canada .
but finally we came .
yeah .
no .
do you see that thingie with -um the flagies ?
really .
-um -um r yellow , blue , and red .
that's our flag .
yeah .
and you you see that those dolls and ?
that's from Colombia (.) too .
yeah .
and someone even gave me like this long , long , long hat .
yeah .
a long hat .
yeah .
they made all of that by theirself .
yeah .
can you imagine ?
by theirself .
yeah .
they didn't buy it from a store .
no .
yeah .
can you imagine ?
building that ?
and building what else ?
did they .
-uh no .
they didn't build that .
they build -um
let me see .
something that they build -uh .
hey !
where is it ?
here is the painting that my mom used to draw .
but then she had to move .
and she forgot them .
mmm soccer .
because .
-um the sport only is on soccer .
they only have soccer .
they don't have no ice hockey .
because -um it only rains it never snowed there .
no it only rains .
in the winter it's funner .
there's some winter .
but instead of snow it rains .
so and sometimes and and in winter it rains too much that that it's clean water .
it drops clean water .
and we get to swim all over it .
it's so cool .
winter's so cool in Colombia .
(...) but it's not good here .
no here it's very chilly .
yeah .
you need like ten or fifteen people .
first -uh I don't know .
I think you should ask that question to my dad .
because he knows lots about soccer .
mmm you have to pass the ball to each other .
and because one time .
we were against this team that was arguing .
the other team that we were against one time .
somebody were not paying attention .
so we just took the ball away .
it was easy to score a goal on them .
yeah .
yeah .
when you put that on .
the camera goes on , right ?
oh cool .
soccer .
I'm number three .
-um -um -um that's because I'm one of the smallest .
yeah .
I'm always one the smallest .
I was the secondest smallest .
I'm always the second smallest !
no .
I wish I could be one of the biggest .
I don't like being small !
no .
well I'm good at school .
the thing is that I'm scared of the ball .
-um (be)cause when someone shoots the ball high .
I do like this .
becuase it hit me in the face really bad .
no .
that that would be a hand ball .
hand ball .
when people touch it .
you can't use your hands .
you can only use your foot .
no .
because .
it's not like volleyball .
-um you can only use your feet .
you cannot use your hands .
only the goalie can .
because because he he the one that needs to save the goal .
that's why .
yeah .
but we can't .
we need to do it with our feet .
-um when the ball's coming .
say this me .
so when the guy's coming with the ball I have to kick it away from him .
and pass it to another person .
run and kick it to another person .
no .
defence you cannot score a goal .
only forward .
no .
I cannot kick so high .
so don't I would never score a goal .
no .
because I'm always defence .
I like defence .
that's why .
-uh yeah .
this weekend ?
-uh I slept all day (.) I think .
no I didn't .
I what did I do ?
what did I do .
-um I can't remember anything .
(be)cause since I had a busy day today .
-um -um I can't remember anything .
because I'm so tired .
yeah .
okay .

no I don't .
yeah .
yeah .
they say bad words .
no .
they they -um hit people .
yeah .
no .
yeah .
and -um but they never hit me because I I don't go outside so much .
they like going outside lots .
so I stay inside .
yeah .
because there a bully here .
a boy .
they're not not next door .
someone way over there .
but he never sees me so .
he might think that like I'm moved to a new house .
well today I think I can go out .
because look (.) no one is
yeah .
no one out .
yeah .
because they can beat me up .
they would too !
would too !
-uh .
-uh -uh I am not sure .
I think I'm gonna would be -uh -uh -uh wai .
-uh no .
-um -uh I think I'll be -uh scientist .
good job ?
I I hope there's still some fossils left .
that I can dig in .
I hope .
yeah .
but it can't .
my dream was that I -um I wish that dinosaurs were alive .
but it can't come true .
because .
they were alive before .
they died !
yeah .
yeah .
because there was this bomb .
that crushed this one .
and it the other one went all the way to the earth .
and there was no more plants .
and once they ate it .
and there was no more .
then they -um they die .
(be)cause there was no more dinosaurs to eat ?
hid under a rock ?
they -um they needed other like plant .
so that .
yeah .
so that's why they died out .
million years ago .
nope .
yeah .
yeah .
and (.) what else ?
yeah .
because he's big and strong and mighty .
yeah .
huh ?
I don't know .
maybe it they they are extinct .
what my friend told me .
that they are extinct .
but like in dark , dark , dark trees .
-um -um they h he says that dinosaurs are still in there .
so you might probably break a tree and and get it .
but the thing is they won't remember how to do anything .
yeah .
they won't remember how to walk .
they won't even remember how to walk .
from such long time .
oh and it wouldn't be a good idea to get them .
because they will eat all the plant .
and finish with all of the plant .
oh yeah .
pretty hopeless .
yeah .
because everybody would die .
okay .
yeah .
hey cool .
oh cool .
he wants to give me a ride .
cool .
-uh no .
that would be so cool if he gave me a ride .
and and then -um if he was my pet .
and and kill the bully .
yeah .
and they die .
yeah .
Colombia .
yeah .
it's nice and hot .
no too so hot as this is .
yeah .
four year ago .
I wish we could move to a new house .
yeah .
no .
not soo much .
it's nice and warm and I get to feel it right now .
ah .
yeah the nice hot sun .
yeah .
they even send me a video .
yeah .
my family (.) was on the video .
I've a big , big family .
like (.) fifteen .
no fifty .
fifty .
because it it's with my mom's family and with my dad's family .
so they can connect all together .
yeah .
and -um -um I was dreaming that -um they came to Canada .
why why is it always me ?
me , me , me ?
but and and this the the crazy part .
and and then -um -um we run .
first they use a lot of my mom and dad's money .
-um and then when we were out of money .
we went back home .
and got my piggy bank .
and we used all of that money .
and then we went to Zellers and bought all of the clothes .
yeah .
and then we only had one penny left .
on ?
nothing .
yep .
yeah .
and then we finally came .
and and all the the house .
you know how big it was ?
s it has like four -um bathrooms .
yeah .
it had four bathrooms .
four bathrooms .
and -um -um like eighteen eighteen -um eighteen .
yeah .
eighteen bedrooms .
and one kitchen .
yeah .
and all of the bedroom were upstairs .
-uh no .
one is upstair(s) .
there and we even got a basement .
yeah .
one was upstairs .
the other one was -uh downstairs .
and the other one was in the basement .
yeah .
mmm Spanish .
yeah .
because I took so much English .
yeah .
English .
because it's easier for me to speak .
yeah .
a little bit hard because I forget some of it .
yeah .
when when when we came to -uh Canada .
but finally we came .
yeah .
no .
do you see that thingie with -um the flagies ?
really .
-um -um r yellow , blue , and red .
that's our flag .
yeah .
and you you see that those dolls and ?
that's from Colombia (.) too .
yeah .
and someone even gave me like this long , long , long hat .
yeah .
a long hat .
yeah .
they made all of that by theirself .
yeah .
can you imagine ?
by theirself .
yeah .
they didn't buy it from a store .
no .
yeah .
can you imagine ?
building that ?
and building what else ?
did they .
-uh no .
they didn't build that .
they build -um
let me see .
something that they build -uh .
hey !
where is it ?
here is the painting that my mom used to draw .
but then she had to move .
and she forgot them .
mmm soccer .
because .
-um the sport only is on soccer .
they only have soccer .
they don't have no ice hockey .
because -um it only rains it never snowed there .
no it only rains .
in the winter it's funner .
there's some winter .
but instead of snow it rains .
so and sometimes and and in winter it rains too much that that it's clean water .
it drops clean water .
and we get to swim all over it .
it's so cool .
winter's so cool in Colombia .
(...) but it's not good here .
no here it's very chilly .
yeah .
you need like ten or fifteen people .
first -uh I don't know .
I think you should ask that question to my dad .
because he knows lots about soccer .
mmm you have to pass the ball to each other .
and because one time .
we were against this team that was arguing .
the other team that we were against one time .
somebody were not paying attention .
so we just took the ball away .
it was easy to score a goal on them .
yeah .
yeah .
when you put that on .
the camera goes on , right ?
oh cool .
soccer .
I'm number three .
-um -um -um that's because I'm one of the smallest .
yeah .
I'm always one the smallest .
I was the secondest smallest .
I'm always the second smallest !
no .
I wish I could be one of the biggest .
I don't like being small !
no .
well I'm good at school .
the thing is that I'm scared of the ball .
-um (be)cause when someone shoots the ball high .
I do like this .
becuase it hit me in the face really bad .
no .
that that would be a hand ball .
hand ball .
when people touch it .
you can't use your hands .
you can only use your foot .
no .
because .
it's not like volleyball .
-um you can only use your feet .
you cannot use your hands .
only the goalie can .
because because he he the one that needs to save the goal .
that's why .
yeah .
but we can't .
we need to do it with our feet .
-um when the ball's coming .
say this me .
so when the guy's coming with the ball I have to kick it away from him .
and pass it to another person .
run and kick it to another person .
no .
defence you cannot score a goal .
only forward .
no .
I cannot kick so high .
so don't I would never score a goal .
no .
because I'm always defence .
I like defence .
that's why .
-uh yeah .
this weekend ?
-uh I slept all day (.) I think .
no I didn't .
I what did I do ?
what did I do .
-um I can't remember anything .

and it doesn't hurt when you land .
no .
but then there's this match .
that this fat guy is fighting a little guy like that little .
and like that really tall .
and then he had a bloody nose .
(be)cause they were fighting for real .
fat guy wasn't letting him touch or anything .
he was just punching him and kicking him and all that .
for real .

(be)cause when I I saw him punch him .
and then I I just saw blood coming out .
no .
yeah .
it's cool .
no .
only when I'm fake wrestling .

then they don't know .
then they just walk back and kl kl close everything .
then Christopher closes the door .
he turns on the lights and we wrestle .

mostly it's Hannah .
no .
she lives (.) in Em road .
Em ?
oh .
it's right down the road .
to there .
not really .
it's pretty close .
I go walking everyday .
not exactly everyday .
sometimes I ride my bike .
and I go with my scooter .
yeah .
yeah .
Em .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
Miss Emtee .
well she kinda put us to work .
but it but just because we do it everyday .
it's getting kinda fun .
math , science , music , gym .
-uh it's kind of mmm gym and recess .
yeah .
and math .
ah .
well it's kinda hard for some people .
and I like it (be)cause it's easy for me .
hm: no .
it's not a competition .
it's just that
for some people it's it's easier .
for some people it's harder .
hm: .
I don't know .
-um just because I've been learning (.) listening .
and everything everyday .
-um .
actually right now the whole school is doing gymnastics .
and then we're (.) doin(g)
we did a piece of soccer .
and then gymnastics .
the whole school is doing .
monkeys .
ow .
yeah .
you have to .
we have a lot of balance balance beams .
yeah .
well .
I like the teachers .
and the best part right now that it is that .
I'm student council in my class .
at the whole school .
-um .
well we just have to choose it from every class .
at least two (.) people .
I mean like one from the girls .
one from the boys .
and one from the girl .
yeah .
it's kinda voting .
we had to vote for our people .
we couldn't vote for ourselves .
so I could't vote for me .
almost .
yeah .
yeah .
-um .
what do we do when when at student council things ?
oh .
we will have meetings with our principal .
Missus Kay .
-um we (.) we k we have to speak on in the microphone .
when when it's an assembly .
yeah .
a little .
some
sometimes .
we have to say what it says on the sheet .
whatever Missus Kay designs .
what she says .
ah .
I had to say some stuff for thank you .
for some people for something .
for our school that helps .
ah .
just to start across the street .
close to our school .
the streets go .
we have a street like that
and maybe one like that .
busy .
hm: .
no .
we never .
that's too important for us .
(be)cause were only kids .
if there was a student council .
for just from the grade fours to the grade sixes .
then I would say yeah .
that would be pretty good .
but from the grade (.) kindergart(en)
I mean grade one from to grade six .
yeah .
yeah .
two from each grade .
not not from each class .
sometimes there is only two girls or two boys .
from one class .
ah .
seven .
I mean
what am I saying .
grade two .
yeah .
one of the biggest classes in the whole school .
yeah .
my (.) is it's gym .
yeah .
yeah .

I hate recess in winter .
it's too cold .
no .
I just hate going outside .

that's medium .
not easy .
not hard .
no .
easy .
still pretty easy .
no .
not yet .
ah .
I think in grade four .
not really .
(be)cause I know some French words .
ah .
well .
I know how to say hello .
I guess .
bonjour .
Hannah .
a girl .
no !
boys hate girls !
kind of .
I like Alexander though .
he's a smart and handsome guy .
hm: .
well .
brownish hair .
brown eyes .
ah .
white skin .
short .
no .
he's kinda .
he has his hair kinda nice like that .
with gel .
yeah .
he wears jeans .
or other pants .
with a belt .
and a shirt .

or the girls .
me too .
I know .

Romania .

three big playgrounds .
one for littlest kids .
one for bigger .
and one for very big kids .
but the big very big kids are too big for me .
and the (.) medium one is good .
it's so fun .
there was this big slide .
and there was this rope you had to climb to get up to the slide .
but we usually took the rope and .
get it on the slide so we can play crocodiles .
then you had to
you fall .
and then you had to get on the rope .
and pulling .
and then they start pulling you up .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
no .
not here .
just because we don't have really much
we don't have a rope .
but we do have a rope and Hannah's house .
with a slide we can
but it's only two or three of us .
(be)cause Hannah has a sister .
how old ?
I know what grade she is in .

older .
grade four .
well I would say
it's shorter in Romania .

it's not a competition .
it's just that
for some people it's it's easier .
for some people it's harder .
hm: .
I don't know .
-um just because I've been learning (.) listening .
and everything everyday .
-um .
actually right now the whole school is doing gymnastics .
and then we're (.) doin(g)
we did a piece of soccer .
and then gymnastics .
the whole school is doing .
monkeys .

that's too important for us .
(be)cause were only kids .
if there was a student council .
for just from the grade fours to the grade sixes .

that would be pretty good .
but from the grade (.) kindergart(en)
I mean grade one from to grade six .

get it on the slide so we can play crocodiles .
then you had to
you fall .
and then you had to get on the rope .
and pulling .
and then they start pulling you up .

not here .
just because we don't have really much
we don't have a rope .
but we do have a rope and Hannah's house .

they sometimes are bored .

sometimes .
they just sit quietly .
and then if nobody's in the kitchen they just go to sleep .
yeah I did .
I always had two .
Bell and Dell .
the boy is Dell .
and the girl is Bell .
because the blue one is a boy .
and the girl one is the green one .
see (be)cause blue goes with boy .
b is with b .
and g is with g .
green for g girl .
yeah .
yeah .
-uh let's see .
Sarah , Jenny .
they just moved to other school .
-um let's see if I remember anybody
Najeeb .
yeah .
-uh (..) okay I don't know .
I guess so .
only three people or something .
I don't know .

she still skates .
I think she ska she skates somewhere a something .
probably Glenora or something .
I don't know .
yeah .
yeah .
Ravi .
his name .
-uh (..) he's nice .
what I hate about him he's too bossy sometimes .
yeah .
yeah .
but we're starting not so good .
(be)cause it's getting like kind of weird .
-uh well nothing .
nothing bad .
but just pushes me up a little .
yeah .
up , up , up .
instead of down .
people usually go down instead of up .
and he pushes me up so it's harder .
so I could be best .
no .
up going higher .
like gooder .
yeah .
so
yeah , yeah .
yeah .
I'm even better than this girl that has been skating for even longer than me .
I'm better than her .
mmhm .
no .
I don't know .
well if she hasn't made big changes , no .
like if she hasn't been skating for everyday over the summer .
yeah .
yeah .
fun .
-um (.) nothing .
so (.) the first time when I just
sometimes we do other stuff beh besides just being on ice .
so like getting warmed up or something .
like ballet .
stretching .
like splits and stuff .
-uh not exactly all the way down .
but yeah .
kind of .
yeah .
I have to .
that's our homework from skating .
and I hate it .
I wanna get better at it .
so I just have to do it .
and then I have no homework .
yay .
yeah .
awesome .
do the middles ?
aw you're awesome .
I can only do the left .
I'm not good at right .
I always fall on to middles on the right .
mmm yeah .
not yet .
that's way too hard .
that's getting too high .
already .
we're just practicing the camel spin .
you know when you have to keep your legs like a t ?
like that .
so we had to spin like that .
that's hard .
I can only spin for like (.) five seconds like that .
it's too hard .
I'm like -eh .
just keep it up .
a actually you don't have to do anything .
just get used to it .
yeah .
yeah , yeah .
I I did that .
I left on
there's like this kind of dance club .
and I hate it .
I went for one day .
and I'm like so bored .
it was boring .
-uh yeah .
well we learn to be graceful in ballet sometimes .
and then like when we get to the senior .
and we're finished all the splits and all kinds of stuff .
we start doing nice things .
like grace
you know , so .
I don't know .
probably fifteen or something .
a lot of flip .
a
(o)kay , let's see .
and that's about it .
I don't know .
I have no idea .
yeah .
there's a sow .
whatever a sow is .
cool .

that would be cool .
yeah .
yeah .
you mean his name .
yeah .
oh man , too many boys .
yeah .
he acts like my dad .
and he makes me cry sometime (be)cause he acts too much like my dad .
and he makes me cry .
and I get into trouble .
and I hate that .
-um well in the middle of the time .
like he after we get like a hundred points for brownies .
he gives us br chocolate brownie .
and I love them too badly .
they're so good .
and I have to be quiet all the time .
so I'm always quiet .
I'm like .
and sometimes he says like funny jokes .
you know .
so it's quite funny .
everybody laughs and then like
I don't know .
everybody says I do .
(be)cause remind(s) reminds me of my dad .
yeah .
no .
he's not bossy .
my dad's nice .
and he's like my dad .

I want math instead of recess .

people tease him sometimes .
his name is Brian Siaych actually .
yeah .

yeah I did .
I always had two .
Bell and Dell .
the boy is Dell .

(be)cause it's getting like kind of weird .
-uh well nothing .
nothing bad .
but just pushes me up a little .
yeah .
up , up , up .
instead of down .
people usually go down instead of up .
and he pushes me up so it's harder .
so I could be best .

yeah , yeah .
yeah .
I'm even better than this girl that has been skating for even longer than me .
I'm better than her .

so then I stop saying it .
rom .
and I'm like like bad thing .
so
(.) just not being polite to my grandma sometimes .
because she's too annoying .
she's like asking too many questions .
I didn't ask so many questions when I was here .
I just followed along .
I didn't do anything wrong .
I'm like .
I just followed along .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
even the cold winter days are new .
yeah .
it only gets to minus fifteen .
that's the k lowest it could go .
I think probably minus twenty or something .
know .
but it gets up to minus something .
it doesn't get as cold as here but .
th it gets quite cold .
but actually people quite enjoy the snow in Romania so .
quite fun .
you do ?
I have no idea .
probably I'm just gonna put my skates on .
tie them on .
put put like the things on .
aw a hockey player .
I don't even have the hockey player costume .
sorry .
or I could be this guy fat guy that like fights .
yeah .
I know .
yeah .
yeah .
we're gonna have cupcakes and stuff .
yeah .
-um you're not allowed to exchange .
that's the bad thing about it .
you're not allowed to like trade candy .
that's no fair .
really ?
why ?
are you supposed to see a certain time ?
we can ?
oh man .
I hate this part .
sure .
whatever .
yeah .
sure .
that'd be fun .
hello .
okay .
hello .
hello .
I guess so .
do what ?
yeah .
yeah .
they sometimes are bored .
yeah .
sometimes .
they just sit quietly .
and then if nobody's in the kitchen they just go to sleep .
yeah I did .
I always had two .
Bell and Dell .
the boy is Dell .
and the girl is Bell .
because the blue one is a boy .
and the girl one is the green one .
see (be)cause blue goes with boy .
b is with b .
and g is with g .
green for g girl .
yeah .
yeah .
-uh let's see .
Sarah , Jenny .
they just moved to other school .
-um let's see if I remember anybody
Najeeb .
yeah .
-uh (..) okay I don't know .
I guess so .
only three people or something .
I don't know .
yeah .
she still skates .
I think she ska she skates somewhere a something .
probably Glenora or something .
I don't know .
yeah .
yeah .
Ravi .
his name .
-uh (..) he's nice .
what I hate about him he's too bossy sometimes .
yeah .
yeah .
but we're starting not so good .
(be)cause it's getting like kind of weird .
-uh well nothing .
nothing bad .
but just pushes me up a little .
yeah .
up , up , up .
instead of down .
people usually go down instead of up .
and he pushes me up so it's harder .
so I could be best .
no .
up going higher .
like gooder .
yeah .
so
yeah , yeah .
yeah .
I'm even better than this girl that has been skating for even longer than me .
I'm better than her .
mmhm .
no .
I don't know .
well if she hasn't made big changes , no .
like if she hasn't been skating for everyday over the summer .
yeah .
yeah .
fun .
-um (.) nothing .
so (.) the first time when I just
sometimes we do other stuff beh besides just being on ice .
so like getting warmed up or something .
like ballet .
stretching .
like splits and stuff .
-uh not exactly all the way down .
but yeah .
kind of .
yeah .
I have to .
that's our homework from skating .

I wanna get better at it .
so I just have to do it .
and then I have no homework .
yay .

do the middles ?
aw you're awesome .
I can only do the left .
I'm not good at right .
I always fall on to middles on the right .
mmm yeah .
not yet .
that's way too hard .
that's getting too high .
already .
we're just practicing the camel spin .
you know when you have to keep your legs like a t ?
like that .
so we had to spin like that .
that's hard .
I can only spin for like (.) five seconds like that .
it's too hard .
I'm like -eh .
just keep it up .
a actually you don't have to do anything .
just get used to it .
yeah .
yeah , yeah .
I I did that .
I left on
there's like this kind of dance club .
and I hate it .
I went for one day .
and I'm like so bored .
it was boring .
-uh yeah .
well we learn to be graceful in ballet sometimes .
and then like when we get to the senior .
and we're finished all the splits and all kinds of stuff .
we start doing nice things .
like grace
you know , so .
I don't know .
probably fifteen or something .
a lot of flip .

and I hate that .
-um well in the middle of the time .
like he after we get like a hundred points for brownies .
he gives us br chocolate brownie .
and I love them too badly .
they're so good .
and I have to be quiet all the time .
so I'm always quiet .
I'm like .
and sometimes he says like funny jokes .
you know .
so it's quite funny .
everybody laughs and then like
I don't know .
everybody says I do .
(be)cause remind(s) reminds me of my dad .
yeah .
no .
he's not bossy .
my dad's nice .
and he's like my dad .
and he cooks good .

that's all I would think of .
yeah .
Chinese checkers .
and for toys (.) I want Barbies .
but it's not for playing .
it's just for like (..) like leaving them as decorations .
Chinese checkers ?
you know there's those little square thing .
you take as much as you can to fill up
well -uh here I use six .
and you play with other people .
and -um you can skip one .
and you can go one .
but you have to follow the lines there .
and whoever got to the other side .
first wins .
well I play it with my grandpa .
I always win him .
and right here my mom told me he let me win just because I'm not very good .
he's just want me to feel happy .
that's all .
but right here every time I have a chance to play with Mommy and Daddy they're the ones who always win .
no .
I know .
yeah .
movies ?
-uh I watch tv a lot .
but movies (..) that depends .

my hat was sort of like little so it would blow off my head .
I had to keep my hand on my hat so it won't blow off .

it was like when I got out with mommy it was like all snowing very hard .
I gone outside .
mommy said that all inside mall there are gums and lollipops .

and then it's like just sitting sitting over here .
there's like double doors to block the water .
first Spongebob runs in out there .
and then this is the water .

and then Sandy doesn't know that he needs air .
so then it's like Spongebob was like drying up .

my s
wait I already said that .
my dad .
my mom .
-um (.) let's see .

I guess .
my favourite food ?
let's see .
that is a very hard question .
yeah .
like (.) -um (.) this is a Chinese food .
it's like we f
well maybe not a Chinese food .
that you can eat when after you like cook them .
and then it's like you cook them .

I only like the inside part .

just like put it up .
a bread .

when we get back to China .
-um in summer break she's almost t one .
uhhuh .
she was born in:
when was my little sister born in ?
August first .
August first .
then he'll be like
let's see .
October thirteenth .
wait .
okay I forgot .
whatever .
yeah .
no .
well I gave my friends some cake .
they're just in -um
let's see .
the manager's -um place .
up there .
he's
yeah .
here I'll show you .
oh I know .
yeah .
it's like you need to put three more monsters .
that are one to four stars .
that's -um on the bottom .
doesn't say you need a sacrifice or two .
you need two sacrifices .
and then it's like you sacrifice all them .
all them in the graveyard .
but you don't lose like any life points .
well whoever runs out of life points .
or all like their cards .
then they lose .
then so so -um then then you you need three sacrifices .
then its attack points will be pretty strong .
instant attack .
life points .
you can like make down to zero .
and then you increase your life points .
and then you can -um suck your life points to his .
by losing like any life points I won .
even like one .
from Tom .
yeah .
-uh most most of my cards are English .
want me to show you one ?
yeah .
have other Chinese cards ?
I dunno .
but I still know its special ability .
I learned its secret special abilities .
that are not even written here .
by watching it .
uhhuh .
yeah .
it's
-um .
no it isn't that secret .
because that card will only last one turn .
but still .
it's like you first put this in the graveyard .
from your hand .
and then you play monster reborn .
and then it will last for one turn .
and you can destroy you eminy .
yeah .
-um he can suck a monster .
yeah into him .
no .
no .
it's like he makes a circle .
around it .
and then the circle .
it like gets into him .
and then he becomes more stronger .
only one monster .
it's like if I have like eight cards in my hand .
and defence points .
zero if I have zero cards in my hand .
he'll only have zero attack points .
and zero defence points .
it's like a card .
that has zer(o) fifty attack points .
and zero defence points .
that's how weak he is .
I know .
without a special ability .
I dunno .

because it's like not summer .
which is a little too hot .
and it's not winter .
which is not a little too cold .
yeah .
-um (.) it's like the snow starts to melt .
and like the trees' leaves like start to grow .
and like birds come out .
and the grass starts to like come out .
the birds start to leave .
it's like everything's the opposite .
the the leaves fall down .
the grass like sinks .
no shrinks .
yeah .
it's kinda -um like someone who gives you wishes .
-um let's see .
because if I duel with somebody .
I'll be unstoppable .
-um let's see .
it's like you put a disk .
and then put it there .

yeah .
it's
no way long .
like (.) let's see .

maybe sometimes they do .
only if they know how to .
yeah .
I have a family .
-um let's see .
my sister .
my little sister .
my brother .
-um (.) my (.) my my (.) grandma .
my second grandma .
my -uh my gran grandpa .
-uh let's see .
my s
wait I already said that .
my dad .
my mom .
-um (.) let's see .
no .
I guess .
my favourite food ?
let's see .
that is a very hard question .
yeah .
like (.) -um (.) this is a Chinese food .
it's like we f
well maybe not a Chinese food .
that you can eat when after you like cook them .
and then it's like you cook them .
and then they're really yummy .
what's a spring roll ?
oh .
no .
and it's really yummy .
I only like the inside part .
no .
no .
I dunno .
no .
yeah .
I never tried it .
but I think I can .
-um maybe first a bread .
-um let's see .
a meat .
-um maybe salad .
and then another bread .
yeah .
yeah .
no .
just like put it up .
a bread .
a meat .
-um a a salad .
and -uh -um the other bread .
mmhm .
yeah .
I don't play with my little sister .
because he was like just born .
when we get back to China .
-um in summer break she's almost t one .
uhhuh .
she was born in:
when was my little sister born in ?
August first .
August first .
then he'll be like
let's see .
October thirteenth .
wait .
okay I forgot .
whatever .
yeah .
no .
well I gave my friends some cake .
they're just in -um
let's see .
the manager's -um place .
up there .
he's
yeah .
here I'll show you .
oh I know .
yeah .
it's like you need to put three more monsters .
that are one to four stars .
that's -um on the bottom .
doesn't say you need a sacrifice or two .
you need two sacrifices .
and then it's like you sacrifice all them .
all them in the graveyard .
but you don't lose like any life points .
well whoever runs out of life points .
or all like their cards .
then they lose .
then so so -um then then you you need three sacrifices .
then its attack points will be pretty strong .
instant attack .
life points .
you can like make down to zero .
and then you increase your life points .
and then you can -um suck your life points to his .
by losing like any life points I won .
even like one .
from Tom .
yeah .
-uh most most of my cards are English .
want me to show you one ?
yeah .
have other Chinese cards ?
I dunno .
but I still know its special ability .
I learned its secret special abilities .
that are not even written here .
by watching it .
uhhuh .
yeah .
it's
-um .
no it isn't that secret .
because that card will only last one turn .
but still .
it's like you first put this in the graveyard .
from your hand .
and then you play monster reborn .
and then it will last for one turn .
and you can destroy you eminy .
yeah .
-um he can suck a monster .
yeah into him .
no .
no .
it's like he makes a circle .
around it .
and then the circle .
it like gets into him .
and then he becomes more stronger .
only one monster .
it's like if I have like eight cards in my hand .
and defence points .
zero if I have zero cards in my hand .
he'll only have zero attack points .
and zero defence points .
it's like a card .
that has zer(o) fifty attack points .
and zero defence points .
that's how weak he is .
I know .
without a special ability .
I dunno .
now I thought of it .
and wanted to be a mailman .
because (.) maybe
have like some exercise .
like send mail to people .
maybe -uh
-uh a police .
or a nurse .
no .
a police or a fireman .
like like chase like people .
that were running from -uh the law .
yeah .
-um like like (.) make people feel better .
what are you on ?
-uh (.) spring and fall .
winter .
spring .
yeah .
because it's like not summer .
which is a little too hot .
and it's not winter .
which is not a little too cold .
yeah .
-um (.) it's like the snow starts to melt .
and like the trees' leaves like start to grow .
and like birds come out .
and the grass starts to like come out .
the birds start to leave .
it's like everything's the opposite .
the the leaves fall down .
the grass like sinks .
no shrinks .
yeah .
it's kinda -um like someone who gives you wishes .
-um let's see .
because if I duel with somebody .
I'll be unstoppable .
-um let's see .
it's like you put a disk .
and then put it there .
uhhuh .
and a real one .
and and the cards were real .
so then it's like I sacrifice three cards .
last wish .
maybe (.) -um (.) let's see .
yeah .
because like my my sister is almost my like favourite in my whole family .
no .

and and that's where they they destroyed the the ring .
in that tower .
there is a volcano inside that tower .

-um .
gym .
and science .
-uh .
be because we ran around about ten times .
sometimes sometimes we play soccer .
and you should see me boot a ball .
I I and and once in my real soccer game .
we we always got them on Wednesdays .
I I would go boot the ball so hard .
I scored another side of it .
it's a gigantic net !
I never knew I could score that far .
ah .
mostly defence , forward , and goalie .
I have never been goalie .
sometimes I'd do .
I cannot forget the times I'm goalie .
and (.) what's the last position ?
yeah .
the centre ones .
midfield yeah .
and my dad used to play soccer .
so did my brother .
and I'm thinking that my mom play soccer .
girl's soccer .
I he already played soccer two times .
on two other teams .
and and he won on both of them .
and my dad took him out of soccer .
I'm already playing a soccer team .
I am .
winter , summer , spring .
-um in yeah .
and in summer it's outdoors I think .
and the rest of the homework .
it's boring .
in grade one I used to be good at math .
I'm I'm still good at math .
I haven't even failed one page .
-uh Colombia .
like (.) Medagin .
Medagin .
it's a small country in Colombia .
and and she lived in it .
and the rest of my family lived in it .
I I don't know .
I think far away .
and and once , I think we went to Hawaii .
I'm not sure .
-uh no .
only one time .
and .
it never snowed in Colombia .
it never got cold .
it was always warm .
ah in like everyday .
and and we had a park in in the condo .
it's it's all buildings .
little houses like these .
and .
so you lived in the city ?
and what what else was I going to tell you ?
and in kindergarten we we never went outside to play .
we played inside .
and and they had this thing all filled up with balls .
and and I used to grab them .
and I put them in my shirt in my arms .
and pretend I was strong .
-um .
my favourite snack is (.) eggs , rice , and (.) .
I forgot the last thing my mom puts in it .
it's this white thing .
it's this liquid thingie .

what else ?
an egg .
first you get eggs .
and you break it .
and you put it in in like (.) in this pot .
it's this yellow thing .
yeah .
butter .
(.) and and then you put these other things .
I forget their names .
and and then you make an egg .
which ever one you got .
sometimes I break it and I leave the whole a(lone) alone .
and I grab it with a spoon .
I put put in my mouth .
and all it squeezes out .
ah first you grab two buns .
and you put ketchup .
and this (.) neat thingie .
(.) it's a squash I do it like that .
and then I eat it with mustard sometimes .
to make a hambuger you grab two buns , meat , and and ketchup and mustard .
and then you eat it .
and a hot dog is just (.) a wiener and and two bun .
and you can probably eat it with ketchup and mustard if you want .
yeah .
on a sandwich I I put cheese .
and (.) .
what was that ?
I put a cheese cheese .
and we got this thing in the kitchen that squeeze squeezes them up .
and melts the cheese .

and he tries taking it off .
and he takes it off .
and I hide .
you cannot find me Micheal .
and he starts looking for me .
and he hides really good .
and he could still find him .
and he could find me .
and once under that table .
I sticked my legs and and my hands on top .

I think it's some straw .

going to sit on there .
maybe not so good there .
maybe a bit further on .
to go down .
some of these are a bit small , aren't they ?
-um .
looking there .
or maybe them are going to drink it now .
some of these are a bit hard to stick down .
-um , he's going to sit with that one .
sitting on the straw .
no , but here comes the cow along .
and they're not there .
a big space for this .
maybe he -um
and then this .
maybe he's pulling it along .
it's getting a bit hard now .
-um .
maybe here .
they're sticks I think .
I put that .
we had this last lesson already .
we had that lesson that they're doing out there .
before they did .
just before they started .
uhhuh .
nah .
was it a play ?
yes .

there wasn't really a bit what I enjoyed most .
this is good what they've got on now .
-um no maybe not standing on there .
shall we do that ?
take the horse off .
there .
looks a bit funny actually .
they seem to be following the same direction .
he's
she she's going t(he) stroke the horse .
maybe a bit further on now .
I missed this stick .
that one's standing up there .
the tractor's right down there .
and a bit not on that bit .
it's a bit hard to stick down on that line .
I put that there .
she's very small .
maybe she could be (.) there .
there .
I put that there .
the bottle things near the house .
there .
some of these are a bit awkward .
and they won't come off .
-um .
-um a shed for maybe the little birds .

one on there .
-um for them I've got this down here .

or maybe no .
taking the saw .
putting the saw there .
and putting the lady .
come off .
there .
-um it's only the milk bottles .
a milk bottle there .
that one's picking at it .
wondering what it is .
and then one down here .
one there .

Flamingo park zoo .

and then we got a coach .
and it was still a long way .
and (a)n(d) it was rather good actually .
yes .
and there was one thing .
there's two things that is my favorite rides .
there was this boat ride that went far up .
and then it could go far up there .
uhhuh .
uhhuh and what lots of people can go on it .
but but I went at the back .
with my brother .
and that's really scary .
and I went with my brother .
eleven .
no .
there is really better than that other ride that I told you about .
it was a boat thing .
and then it went on the lake .
and then it went up this water hill .
right ?
and me and Ian went on it two times .
and my mum and dad went it on it once .
well , it wasn't they weren't in favor o(f) it when it was going up and down .
but it was fun .
I went on it on the second time I was right at the front of the boat and I got soaking .
uhhuh .
but was a very big splash in the end .
and then it goes round the lake .
so we stayed in .
and then it was on the next move move ride .
and then mum my mum and dad got in .
and then it went along the lake again .
up the hill down the hill splash .
and and then round a bit bit .
and then we we got off .
my mum took a photograph .
uhhuh me and Ian with with the water going on .
but my mum and dad didn't wanna go in that boat thing .
a little bit of a scary cats .
no .
they never would go on it .
and what's the number on the other side ?
the number's three .
and then on the other side it's way away .
forty four .
no .
I know who who that is then .
the milkman .
well I think that's the postman because he's got letters in .
-um .
maybe a doctor .
the milkman .
put him onto the door .
that one I called a doctor .
I called a doctor .
and he is going to that house as well .
the postman .
the this is getting easy .
this one man kneeling down .
the man kneeling down .
where where shall we put him now .
uhhuh .
yes .
I know .
the one with the green jacket on .
she is going round to the other house .
so she is going that way .
the one who's holding the little little girl .
and she is actually going to that house .
the other way round .
that one with long hair .
that's sweeping up .
and that girl is running .
the girl that's running .
she's going down that way .
it is a bit too many people here though , isn't there ?
it's a bit busy .
little the little girl that's putting a dolly in her pram .
and she can be going out .
with that child .
but somebody's in the way .
unless it's already moved .
little girl that's kneeling down .
she can be
where can we put her ?
she can be
maybe she's asking him something .
-um .
and it's on .
we could put somebody kicking it though .
we could put somebody kicking it .
I don't know .
maybe her .
the ball .
the one that's on it's own .
and she is kicking that ball .
the one with the red jumper on .
and he's going down the lane .
here .
-um the person who's holding those two balls .
and she is going turning that way .
uhhuh .
-um that gives me a good idea there .
it gives me
she could be behind the car .
the car could be in front .
we put her there though .
it it might be a bit easier there .
the racing car .
we'll put
and it go over there .
we can't properly get
then we can get it in .
uhhuh .
-um the little boy who's pulling the car .
-um he's
it's a bit of a busy time this .
the blue car .
where shall we put that though ?
-um there's one space .
yes , there is .
there .
you can't see where I put that , can you ?
I know .
the grey cat .
and then that that cat that's brown .
brown and white .
we can make em having a party .
maybe they're going in the back way .
and he's going in the front way .
because it's getting a bit crowded at the front .
barks .
that one that's lying down looks like a pussy cat .
it would without that long mouth .
the one that's jumping up .
he's jumping up at them .
the grey one .
that laying down .
-um and he's looking at the the cats .
and the cat's looking at him .
-um .
we put that at the back .
see if there's any room at the back .
there is .
-um good .
it's a bit awkward with this milk bottle cause he is carrying some m milk bottles .
is it
and she's going t(he) pick it up and and pretend to fee feed her .
yes .
uhhuh .
that's where I put them .
and that's where I put the racing car .
on top .
it's a bit easy .
bed first .
you always have bed first .
and then maybe that's second or don't you think so ?
that next .
she's woke up in the morning .
she's in the bathroom looking in the mirror and combing her hair .
then she has tea .
then she goes to school .
and then she works at school .
easy w(h)eezy .
-um maybe it it's not might not be so easy .
first maybe that .
that come through the door .
then that .
then that .
then that .
the bowl's left on it's own .
the cat's peeping through the door .
it comes near the bowl .
he's up on the table , puts his paw in .
he's broken it .
and the fish will be dead .
no .
that was a bit too easy .
both of them .
he
he goes to bed .
she eats .
to her friends .
him a balloon .
was watching tellie .
they'll hurt themselves .
he couldn't reach it .
shall go to bed .
would tie his shoes .

that Tom lives in .
which mummie made .
the fastest .
as as her little sister .
biggest .
more ?
I think he's going to school or he's going to his own house .
and he's going to get a balloon .
he's giving him a balloon .
he's took the balloon .
he's taking the balloon home .
it blows away .
he cries .
shakes .
it never ever happens to me .
-um I've seen one of them before .
I I pretend I make it bite somebody .
no .
no .
he doesn't even go to school .
tiger goes to bed late .
tiger is not nasty .
tiger is not frightened .
tiger doesn't eat children .
tiger cannot fly .
tiger doesn't have a smartie .
do you have a smartie ?
is it tasty ?

but it was fun .
I went on it on the second time I was right at the front of the boat and I got soaking .

but was a very big splash in the end .
and then it goes round the lake .
so we stayed in .
and then it was on the next move move ride .
and then mum my mum and dad got in .
and then it went along the lake again .
up the hill down the hill splash .
and and then round a bit bit .

going to sit on there .
maybe not so good there .
maybe a bit further on .
to go down .

got some kind of lamp !
but the
got some kind of lamp !
it'll go on the bridge .
it'll flash on the bridge .
it's not the sun .
it's just a light .
that's all what it is .
we need some kind of plug .
it won't work .
trzeba przedluzacz .
czy moge wziac od lampy ?
nie wystarczy .
I
I know what I can do !
cause I'm making the big station I'll put it on the station !
it'll be the station light .
but this is not Legos .
with Legos ?
I'm building the train station .
for now .
0it's supposed to flash on the bridge .
bridge where ?
it's gonna go up on the table ?
what did you say I have to fix ?
what kind of tracks ?
ok .
I need a little one .
like this one .
I need this kind .
I know what can be over here !
under this bridge !
I know what can be under this bridge .
the car's going .
trains go
ahhah .
doesn't matter if it still works .
if it's broken or not .
cause that train gets off the tracks when it's broken .
now like over here (.) you can't use it .
see ?
or else the whole train (.) get off the tracks immediately .
so what I'll do I'll do railroad crossing over here .
and the next part I'll put it over here and then this will go over here .
they don't make the cars stop .
mama !
powiedz co tu pisze !
this is the upstairs .
ok this is the upstairs .
this is the upstair .
we're not done with that part .
we're not done with that part .
it's just gonna mess us up .
why ?
this is where people come in .
this is the cass to buy tickets .
no it don't .
so the man's supposed to stand on the road ?
how all the people get in ?
look .
so it has to be here .
look .
my idea is
I need all red ones like this .
we're building the upstairs now .
the upstairs .
but they have to be the same high .
I need it all those kind of .
it could be any color .
but it has to be that high .
no .
it's not how it's supposed to go .
that's not how it's supposed to go .
yes it is .
the upstairs's supposed to look like the upstairs .
