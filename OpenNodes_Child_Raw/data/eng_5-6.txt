the grandfather (i)s cooking and the boy is pouring .
and the girl (i)s pouring .
and all of the other things that he's pouring (.) the boy .
I don't know what they're making either .
let (u)s find out in the other picture .
okay .
yes .
they're playing and swinging .
then they do it by theirselves .
and the boy is sliding down .
and the girl is going up .
and the girl is swinging .
and the dad push the girl .
and the boy is sliding .
and that's it .
but there's a couple of trees around there too .
did I forget something ?
I see some McDonalds stuff .
and this is for the hamburger .
and it opens .
yes .
a cup .
juice (.) something to drink .
napkins .
bag to put stuff in .
and a fork .
and a knife .
a straw .
and no money .
yes .
at Mcdonalds .
yes .
that's the place were I go .
and they have milkshakes too .
yes .
yes .
where did you get these anyhow ?
I think Mcdonalds .
no .
you shouldn't let me use a a sharp knife like this .
but these ain't sharp knifes here .
and I guess that's it .
you eat first and then you cut it .
and then you wipe your mouth after your done and then you use your use your box .
and then put the money in it .
mhm (.) no .
the tables and chairs .
and people .
and that's it .
what is this ?
it's a towel .
yes for drying .
can we open it ?
there's something in it ?
no .
powder .
it's real powder .
yes .
what's in here ?
let (u)s put that on .
hey !
you forgot this .
to take a bath .
okay .
I can't think of anything .
this is a mistake .
no .
I wanna do the farm next .
so I can take a bath I go into the bathroom .
and then you go in and put the water on .
and then you wash yourself .
and then you'll put soap (.) on yourself .
then when you're finished you dry yourself off .
no .
put powder on you .
that's what my mom does sometimes .
she did that last night .
yes .
I pinched my leg .
uhuh .
get out of the bathtub and then you dry yourself off .
and then you blow dry your hair .
that's all I can think of .
here is some milk .
you move the tail .
let me see what this is .
quack .
and there's other stuff .
once upon a time there was chicken who said baak .
but then the horse said nah .
and then he wanted some milk .
so I gotta get some milk .
what the heck ?
I think I'm gonna get some milk here .
gulp .
he's eating .
it's so nice to be on the farm here .
I got a farm that's in mm Jamestown .
yes .
and there's a barn near it .
and then there is a backdoor .
yes .
and then there's all kind of things that for you to go in .
two times I've been there .
mm does taste good .
and that was the story of the farm .
who got knocked down ?
I think I want something else too .
look (.) the back doesn't opened .
yes .
but this can slide opened .
they're hiding from you .
because they're eating .
they're scared of you .
yes .
come out .
and it goes up and down .
the first time I was here there was a lion here .
I think we lost our lion .
there we go .
and he's gonna eat .
too .
and then the cow said moo .
gosh .
so I locked the people inside the barn .
I just locked the farmer in there .
now let (u)s give the people some milk .
did I knock something down ?
I didn't catch .
that's the sink .
and then there's the milk for the horsies .
but he seems too short to reach in .
and look at my farm .
and the baak chickens .
Chita and Wally .
Chita and Wally .
yes .
mm .
so they're all locked in .
and the monkey's tail is hanging out .
put the farmer over here .
it's time to eat .
come on , horsie .
lemme have the dish .
and he's gonna pour some milk .
he's pouring some milk .
here .
here (.) do you want some sheep ?
here (.) you want some .
look (.) have some .
he's taking his bath .
wow .
in the water .
in the milk .
that's silly .
there he is .
yes .
there .
now I have a nice farm .
and there's the fire .
it's burning up .
their house is burning up .
the cow left it burn .
fire fire .
fire fire .
fire fire fire fire .
water water .

now I'm gonna pour some water .
and then it won't burn anymore .

I wanna do the farm next .
so I can take a bath I go into the bathroom .

that's all I can think of .
here is some milk .

once upon a time there was chicken who said baak .

I think I'm gonna get some milk here .
gulp .

the first time I was here there was a lion here .
I think we lost our lion .
there we go .
and he's gonna eat .

and then the cow said moo .

so I locked the people inside the barn .
I just locked the farmer in there .
now let (u)s give the people some milk .
did I knock something down ?
I didn't catch .
that's the sink .
and then there's the milk for the horsies .
but he seems too short to reach in .
and look at my farm .
and the baak chickens .
Chita and Wally .
Chita and Wally .

so they're all locked in .
and the monkey's tail is hanging out .
put the farmer over here .

Superheroes .
once there was superman .
then Spiderman came .
and spun a web .
and swung to a building .
it was the root of the building .
and then Rocksteady and Bebop and Shredder came .
and they had a big , big , very long fight .
and then they ate pizza .
and that's the end .
once there was Superman .
then Spiderman came .
then Batman and Robin came .
they fighted three ghosts .
the ghosts are still alive .
so they just left the ghosts alone .
but the ghosts weren't really ghosts .
they were robbers with costumes on to look like ghosts .
then the robbers turned into more bad guys .
they turned into three more bad guys .
they fighted .
the good guys won .
that's the end .
once there was a knight with a sword and a shield .
he fighted the Loch Ness monster .
but nobody won .
he just drew on a piece of paper .
the end .
once there was Superman .
then Spiderman came .
and they fighted nothing .
and then a buffalo came .
Batman and Robin came .
they fighted Catwoman and Riddler .
then Black knight with a sword came .
they fighted .
that's the end .
then they had a birthday party .
once there was a talking bathtub .
the talking bathtub fills its mouth up with water .
then it talks to itself .
and the water spills out of its mouth .
then a deer who did hear went to the bathtub .
and said bye .
and went away .
the deer snuck a candycane out of its tongue .
and went to a frisbee that talked .
a boy picked it up .
and made it fly because he threw it .
it landed in a birthday cake .
and it looked like a monster because it was covered with cake .
then it flew away .
and it ate a spying ring .
but the spying ring spied on him .
and he did not like that so he spit it out .
then the ring spied on him some more so the frisbee ran away because he thought the ring would spy on him .
but the ring would not do that .
then the deer came .
and ate itself up .
and turned into a picture of a person .
the end .
once there was an angel .
the angel went for a walk .
but there is danger nearby .
but the angel did not know it .
but people came .
and told him so he flew into the sky so he wouldn't get hurt .
but he is wrong .
so he flew to another dimension .
but then Superwoman came to fight the bad guys .
and Superman came with her to do the same thing .
and fight the bad guys .
Superman and Superwoman won the fight .
the angel did what he liked in the other dimension .
and he did not want to come back till the fight was over .
the end .
one time somebody did something very bad at school so they had to go out on the hall .
but they cried so loud that they had to come back in .
a silly story .
there once were three men .
one only knew how to say apples .
but he never said anything because he forgot how to .
then a walking bathtub comes .
and knocks him so he falls down into the bathtub .
the bathtub had water in it .
and he floated in the water of the bathtub .
then he yelled help .
and the help pit popped out of his mouth .
and he remembered how to talk .
then two other men came running .
but when they got there , they were so tired that they just fell asleep .
the end .
once there was a king .
and like all the other kings , he was sitting in his throne .
then the king heard a sound that went like thump , thump , thump .
so the king called his knights to look out the windows to see what the thump , thump , thump was .
what the thump , thump , thump was the sound of bad guys' horses' feet hitting the ground .
so the knights told the king that there are bad guys coming so the king got his armor .
but then Merlin made the king and his knights float up through the window onto the ground .
but the knights already had their armor on .
they got it on before they floated up and onto the ground .
so the king and his knights fighted with the bad knights .
but no one won .
so the good knights called Merlin .
and Merlin took care of those bad guys .
so Merlin told the king what he did to the bad guys .
and the king was King Arthur .
the end .
once there was a mouse .
the mouse always lived in a house .
the mouse smelled some cheese so it followed the smell of the cheese .
it found the cheese .
it ate the cheese .
the cheese is very big .
it was three feet wide and ten feet tall so the mouse got very fat .
then there was a person who found it .
and the person was a he .
the person's name was Aliasor .
but the mouse wasn't a plain mouse , the kind you see every day .
it was a transforming mouse so it could turn into anything it wanted to .
it turned into a monster which was on the bad side .
so Aliasor and the monster fighted .
and Aliasor won .
and the monster died .
once there was a cowboy .
and then a knight came .
and then the knight fighted the cowboy .
and they both won .
but the cowboy wasn't no regular cowboy .
he lost his gun so he had a bow and arrow instead .
so the cowboy and the knight were still fighting .
so they thought that no one would win .
but they wanted to see if someone would win so they kept on fighting .
so they fighted for one more minute .
and then they stopped .
so then they saw that no one would win .
so then he ran for the deer .
and he shot a arrow at the deer so the deer died because the arrow hit it so he ate the deer .
the end .
once there was Robin Hood .
then there was a bad guy with a bazooka .
they fighted .
and just Robin Hood shot an arrow .
and it hit the bad guy's bazooka .
and then it bounced off the bazooka .
and then the arrow hit the bad guy in his bottom .
so then he went ouch .
and jumped right up .
and then when the bad guy landed , he landed on his back .
then the bad guy got back up on to his feet .
then Robin Hood shot another arrow .
so then the arrow hit the bazooka again .

uhhuh .
shakes .

that's a sheep hay .

and it goes sssup .
Mrs Dooley's , the first one .
yes .
I got a marrying dress for my Barbie .
a Barbie clothes and (.) forgotten now .
and I got something else .
and I brought them .
I played hide and seek .
and then
where shall we put this ?
yeah .
house .
I think that one .
I think
that that'll be the farmhouse .
no , that one .
(be)cause the hay can go in there (be)cause that looks like hay .
I know .
-um , this is a nice game .
uhhuh , (be)cause you can't bend them , can you .
yeah .
so you can get all the chickens off .
even you could get them off .
uhhuh .
uhhuh .
put him on as well then .
and she's feeding the ducks .
she can only feed these ones .
bread .
uhhuh .
yeah , (.) was falling on our birdhouse .
shakes .
it was too cold .
-um .
I think that man can .
(be)cause that's got that .
no .
you see .
laughs .
yeah .
yeah .
that should be be going on the horse .
like that .
sposta go like that .
uhhuh .
this ?
thought he was on .
I'll hafta take the tractor off again and put him there .
but he must have a s
it's hard .
I think he'll
it's one of the big ones .
how did that get off ?
what was that ?
laughs .
I think
he should be
do you think it should be with the horse or the cow ?
I think that he's not milking the c cow .
think
(be)cause the cow's over there .
and now he may feed her .
get the milk out of her udders over there .
yeah .
and this one .
all the cows fit in now .
except the horses (be)cause horses do look a little bit (.) like cows .
but they don't .
(be)cause that
you know that .
that
(be)cause they haven't got (.) their mummie .
they
no .
no , so you know which is which .
yeah .
(be)cause he'd be like this .
where shall we put the windmill ?
I'm gonna get that .
-um .
I got my t-shirt done in the afternoon .
we done some of our books .
but because yesterday we went off .
and this afternoon .
we're gonna do the man .
but we hafta go home .
when it was twelve o'clock .
what does that hay go with ?
(be)cause that cow's got nothing .
I think it goes with the cow .
no , I'm gonna put that one with it .
yeah , (be)cause he's already got one .
so we can move him .
uhhuh .
points .
but that's a sheep hay .
so he's eating it .
not fast but I think he can gonna eat slow .
a white one .
white one's nice .
so would I .
I've rided a donkey .
in my holidays .
you we went up and then back down again .
no , where fair is , well , that's where I went .
haven't been in this room before .
I think sometimes .
but there's lots of chair chairs .
I think that one
that girl touching that tree .
it is , I think .
no , (be)cause that we had a fairy on the top .
nice chocolates .
what kind of chocolates did you have ?
yeah , that's what ours was look like .
uhhuh .
this one sh
she's a nice girl .
I think
no .
just touching it .
oh .
I got no more man .
not always that one .
-um , could .
yeah .
and I've got a better idea .
sitting down there .
he's
I'm gonna .
it's upside down .
no .
ladies don't work though .
no .
I think I've got a better idea .
pretend it's dropped .
someone dropped it .
he can chop it up for his dinner and make a roast pork .
oh , this this is by the big one .
ahhah .
think that sposta go in there .
yeah .
that can go in there .
just in case it falls out .
no .
no .
Mrs Bryant's .
Marleen and Joanne (.) and Louise .
we've done a mistake .
I think he should .
(be)cause he's got his heads out , he can .
it's our class , I think .
things .
I've got a better idea .
can you imagine what he's doing ?
can you ?
eating the grass .
uhhuh .
he's eating the bottom of it .
hasta .
but I don't where they can go .
I know , (be)cause once I went to a farm last year ago .
I saw one of them there .
and I saw all like this .
nice .
more but I went past it .
and there was someone riding that .
I mean , there was someone pushing it (.) round .
this ?
it's a door .
I think that can go there for the pg .
and the pigs can go in it .
I don't know where pg lives .
got a better idea .
do you know when a pg styes , I mean , (be)cause that's where they really really live .
I think (.) yes .
I've got a good idea .
what was your idea ?
is it ?
I'm waiting to know where (.) we can just chop my wood off .
put that in .
like that .
and that there .
we can put them .
I think it's the same as that .
yeah .
but it goes with the
yeah .
let's put them like that (be)cause they're the size , aren't they .
yeah .
oh .
that can have two of them in .
-um .
oh , silly me .
I forgot to take it off first .
my nails (wi)ll let me .
it's a good idea .
-um , (.) yeah .
might as well put that on somewhere .
what's your name ?
yeah .
there's a girl called Louise in our class .
yeah .
yeah .
shall I tell you why she's nice ?
(be)cause she's so good .
I'm good .
yeah .
I might be hungry angry .
does this one stick off ?
I think that
what do you think this can be ?
ahhah !
fence .
and where's the tent ?
that one .
that big one there .
yeah .
where did you get that from ?
and that's
where did I put my bucket ?
I have lost my bucket .
is it ?
I just put that there .
except (be)cause someone's dropped it .
now where did I put this bucket ?
a bucket .
there .
oh .
oh , I think we have .
it's something like that .
horse .
yeah , (be)cause it's a baby horse .
that's the hay .
and the man (.) could be getting into that .
and he's just about getting the lid off .
but he hasn't .
lovely boat .
when I went to my farm it was like that .
do you get them off ?
yeah .
in that bag .
I know but we got something stiff .

how did that get off ?
what was that ?
laughs .
I think
he should be
do you think it should be with the horse or the cow ?
I think that he's not milking the c cow .
think
(be)cause the cow's over there .
and now he may feed her .
get the milk out of her udders over there .
yeah .
and this one .
all the cows fit in now .
except the horses (be)cause horses do look a little bit (.) like cows .
but they don't .
(be)cause that
you know that .
that
(be)cause they haven't got (.) their mummie .
they
no .
no , so you know which is which .
yeah .
(be)cause he'd be like this .
where shall we put the windmill ?
I'm gonna get that .

I'm gonna .

I think that can go there for the pg .
and the pigs can go in it .
I don't know where pg lives .
got a better idea .
